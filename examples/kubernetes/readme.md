# K8s `kubectl` YAMLs for Cube.js

This is a place for community members to share their Kubectl YAML examples to deploy Cube.js. If you are interested in contributing your Kubectl YAML examples, we ask that you create a new (sub)directory and include all your file contents in the directory. 

## Support

The Kubectl YAMLs in this directory are **community supported** and should be used at your own risk. If you have any questions about individual files, you should contact the original author.
