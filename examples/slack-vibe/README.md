## About Slack Vibe ðŸŽ‰

*Slack Vibe* is an open-source dashboard of public activity in any Slack workspace of an open community or a private team.

It combines the power of Cube.js with data about public activity in any Slack workspace of an open community or a private team. *Slack Vibe* knows everything:

* Is your audience still growing?
* Which days of a week are the hottest?
* Which emoji reactions are over-used by community admins?
