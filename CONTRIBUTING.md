## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

Cube.js works with Node.js 10+ and uses Yarn as a package manager.

### Cube.js Docker

Cube.js offers two different types of Docker image:

- Stable (building from published release on npm)
- Dev (building from source files, needed to test unpublished changes)

For more information, take a look at [Docker Development Guide](./packages/cubejs-docker/DEVELOPMENT.md).

#### Stable Docker Release

1. After cloning Cube.js repository run `yarn install` in `packages/cubejs-docker` to install dependencies.
2. Use `docker build -t cubejs/cube:latest -f latest.Dockerfile` in `packages/cubejs-docker` to build stable docker image.

#### Development

1. After cloning Cube.js repository run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
2. Use `docker build -t cubejs/cube:dev -f dev.Dockerfile ../../` to build stable development image.

### Cube.js Client

1. After cloning Cube.js repository run `yarn install` in root directory.
2. Use `yarn link` to add these packages to link registry.
3. Perform required code changes.
4. Use `yarn build` in the repository root to build CommonJS and UMD modules.
5. Use `yarn link @cubejs-client/core` and/or `yarn link @cubejs-client/react` in your project to test changes applied.
6. Use `yarn test` where available to test your changes.
7. Ensure that any CommonJS and UMD modules are included as part of your commit.

To get set up quickly, you can perform 1) and 2) with one line from the `cube.js` clone root folder:

```
$ cd packages/cubejs-client-core && yarn && yarn link && cd ../.. && cd packages/cubejs-client-react && yarn && yarn link && cd ../..
```

### Cube.js Server

#### Prerequisites

If you are going to develop a JDBC driver, you need to [install Java with JDK][link-java-guide].

[link-java-guide]:
https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/blob/master/packages/cubejs-jdbc-driver/README.md#java-installation

#### Development

Cube.js is written in a mixture of plain JavaScript and Typescript. TypeScript is preferred for new code.

> Attention: Cube.js uses TypeScript configured in incremental mode, which uses cache to speed up compilation,  
> but in some cases, you can run into a problem with a not recompiled file. To fix it, we recommend running `$ yarn clean` and `$ yarn tsc`.

1. Clone the Cube.js repository, `git clone https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js`. 
2. Run `yarn install` in the root directory.
3. Run `yarn build` in the root directory to build the frontend dependent packages. 
4. Run `yarn build` in `packages/cubejs-playground` to build the frontend.
5. Run `yarn tsc:watch` to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.
6. Run `yarn link` in `packages/cubejs-<pkg>` for the drivers and dependent packages you intend to modify. 
7. Run `yarn install` in `packages/cubejs-<pkg>` to install dependencies for drivers and dependent packages.
8. Run `yarn link @cubejs-backend/<pkg>` in `packages/cubejs-server-core` to link drivers and dependent packages.
9. Run `yarn link` in `packages/cubejs-server-core`.
10. Create or choose an existing project for testing.
11. Run `yarn link @cubejs-backend/server-core` in your project directory. 
12. Run `yarn dev` to start your testing project and verify changes.

### Debugging with WebStorm

1. Follow all the steps from the previous section. Make sure that the `yarn tsc:watch` daemon is running in the background.
2. Open the cube.js project in WebStorm.
3. Create a new configuration, using `./node_modules/.bin/cubejs-server` for Node Parameters and the directory of your test project for Working directory.
4. Run/Debug dev cube.js servers using the new configuration.

### Implementing a Driver

1. Copy existing driver package structure and name it in `@cubejs-backend/<db-name>-driver` format.
`@cubejs-backend/mysql-driver` is a very good candidate for copying this structure.
2. Please do not copy *CHANGELOG.md*.
3. Name driver class and adjust package.json, README.md accordingly.
4. As a rule of thumb please use only Pure JS libraries as a dependencies where possible.
It increases driver adoption rate a lot.
5. Typically, you need to implement only `query()` and `testConnection()` methods of driver.
The rest will be done by `BaseDriver` class.
6. If db requires connection pooling prefer use `generic-pool` implementation with settings similar to other db packages.
7. Make sure your driver has `release()` method in case DB expects graceful shutdowns for connections.
8. Please use yarn to add any dependencies and run `$ yarn` within the package before committing to ensure right `yarn.lock` is in place.
9. Add this driver dependency to [cubejs-server-core/core/DriverDependencies.js](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/blob/master/packages/cubejs-server-core/core/DriverDependencies.js#L1).

### Implementing a JDBC Driver

If there's existing JDBC Driver in place for Database of interest you can just create `DbTypes` configuration inside
[cubejs-jdbc-driver/driver/JDBCDriver.js](https://github.com/statsbotco/cube.js/blob/master/packages/cubejs-jdbc-driver/driver/JDBCDriver.js#L31).
Most of the time no additional adjustments required for base `JDBCDriver` implementation as JDBC is pretty standard.
In case you need to tweak it a little please follow [Implementing Driver](#implementing-driver) steps but use `JDBCDriver` as your base driver class.

### Implementing SQL Dialect

1. Find the most similar `BaseQuery` implementation in `@cubejs-backend/schema-compiler/adapter`.
2. Copy it, adjust SQL generation accordingly and put it in driver package. Driver package will obtain `@cubejs-backend/schema-compiler` dependency from that point.
3. Add `static dialectClass()` method to your driver class which returns `BaseQuery` implementation for the database. For example:
```javascript
const { BaseDriver } = require('@cubejs-backend/query-orchestrator');
const FooQuery = require('./FooQuery');

class FooDriver extends BaseDriver {
  // ...
  static dialectClass() {
    return FooQuery;
  }
}
```
If driver class contains `static dialectClass()` method it'll be used to lookup corresponding SQL dialect. Otherwise, it will use the default dialect for the database type.

### Publishing Driver npm Package

Cube.js looks up `cubejs-{dbType}-driver` package among installed modules to fullfil driver dependency if there's no corresponding default driver for the specified database type.
For example one can publish `cubejs-foo-driver` npm package to fullfil driver dependency for the `foo` database type.

### Testing Schema Compiler

In order to run tests in `cubejs-schema-compiler` package you need to have running [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your machine.
When it's up and running just use `yarn test` in `packages/cubejs-schema-compiler` to execute tests.

### Client Packages

If you want to make changes to the Cube.js client packages and test them locally in your project you can do it the following way:
1. Make the desired changes and run `yarn build` in the root directory (you can also use `yarn watch`)
2. Go to the `~/some-path/cube.js/packages/cubejs-client-core` directory and run `yarn link`. (You'll see the messages _Registered **"@cubejs-client/core"**_)
3. Now you can link it in your project (e.g. _/my-project/dashboard-app_). You can do so running `yarn link "@cubejs-client/core"`

If you want to make changes to the `@cubejs-client/react` package you'll need a few extra steps
1. Go to your project's **node_modules** directory and find the react package (e.g. _/my-project/dashboard-app/node_modules/react_ and run `yarn link`
2. Go to the `~/some-path/cube.js/packages/cubejs-client-react` directory and run `yarn link react`

Now your project will be using the local packages.

**NOTE:** You might need to restart your project after linking the packages.

### Rust Packages

Please use `cargo test` to test packages and `cargo fmt` to format code before commit.

## Style guides

We're passionate about what code can do rather how it's formatted.
But in order to make code and docs maintainable following style guides will be enforced.
Following these guidelines is not a requirement, but you can save some time for maintainers if you apply those to your contribution beforehand.

### Code

1. Run `yarn lint` in package before committing your changes.
If package doesn't have lint script, please add it and run.
There's one root `.eslintrc.js` file for all packages except client ones.
Client packages has it's own `.eslintrc.js` files.
2. Run `yarn test` before committing if package has tests.
3. Please use [conventional commits name](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for your PR.
It'll be used to build change logs.
All PRs are merged using squash so only PR name matters.
4. For the scope part of commit name please use package name if it's within one package or don't use it if change spans multiple packages. For example `feat(@cubejs-backend/server-core):` or `fix(cubestore):`.
5. Do not reformat code you aren't really changing unless it's absolutely necessary (e.g. fixing linter). Such changes make it really hard to use git blame feature when we need to find a commit where line change of interest was introduced.
