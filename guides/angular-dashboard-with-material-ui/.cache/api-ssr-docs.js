/**
 * Called after every page Gatsby server renders while building HTML so you can
 * set head and body components to be rendered in your `html.js`.
 *
 * Gatsby does a two-pass render for HTML. It loops through your pages first
 * rendering only the body and then takes the result body HTML string and
 * passes it as the `body` prop to your `html.js` to complete the render.
 *
 * It's often handy to be able to send custom components to your `html.js`.
 * For example, it's a very common pattern for React.js libraries that
 * support server rendering to pull out data generated during the render to
 * add to your HTML.
 *
 * Using this API over [`replaceRenderer`](#replaceRenderer) is preferable as
 * multiple plugins can implement this API where only one plugin can take
 * over server rendering. However, if your plugin requires taking over server
 * rendering then that's the one to
 * use
