title: "How to Build a Dashboard"

Cube.js Developer Playground has one more feature to explore.

Let's go to the "Dashboard App" tab where you can generate the code for a front-end application with a dashboard (big surprise!). There's a variety of templates for different frameworks (React and Angular included) and charting libraries there but you can always choose to "create your own".

Let's choose "React", "React Antd Dynamic", "D3", and click "OK". Just in a few seconds you'll have a newly created front-end app in the `dashboard-app` folder. Click "Start dashboard app" to run it, or do the same by navigating to `dashboard-app` and running:

```bash
npm run start
```

Believe it or not, this dashboard app will allow you to do what you've already tried. On the "Explore" tab, you can create a query, tailor the chart, and then click "Add to dashboard". On the "Dashboard" tab, you'll see the result.

Impressive? We'll go further than that, so open your window blinds! ✈️
