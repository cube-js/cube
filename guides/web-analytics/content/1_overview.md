Building your own analytics engine, like the one behind Google Analytics, sounds like a very sophisticated engineering problem. And it truly is. Back then, it would require years of engineering time to ship such a piece of software. But as data landscape changes, now we have a lot of tools which solve different parts of this problem extremely well: data collection, storage, aggregations, and query engine. By breaking the problem into smaller pieces and solving them one-by-one by using existing open-source tools, we will be able to build our own web analytics engine.

If youâ€™re familiar with Google Analytics (GA), you probably already know that every web page tracked by GA contains a GA tracking code. It loads an async script that assigns a tracking cookie to a user if it isnâ€™t set yet. It also sends an XHR for every user interaction, like a page load. These XHR requests are then processed, and raw event data is stored and scheduled for aggregation processing. Depending on the total amount of incoming requests, the data will also be sampled.

Even though this is a high-level overview of Google Analytics essentials, itâ€™s enough to reproduce most of the functionality.

You can check [the demo application here](https://web-analytics-demo.cube.dev/) and its [source code is available on Github.](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/tree/master/examples/web-analytics)

## Architecture overview

Below you can see the architecture of the application we are going to build. We'll use Snowplow for data collection, Athena as the main data warehouse, MySQL to store pre-aggregations, and Cube.js as the aggregation and querying engine. The frontend will be built with React, Material UI, and Recharts. Although the schema below shows some AWS services, they can be partially or fully substituted by open-source alternatives: Kafka, MinIO, and PrestoDB instead of Kinesis, S3, and Athena, respectively.

We'll start with data collection and gradually build the whole application, including the frontend. If you have any questions while going through this guide, please feel free to join this [Slack Community](https://slack.cube.dev) and post your question there.

Happy hacking! ðŸ’»
