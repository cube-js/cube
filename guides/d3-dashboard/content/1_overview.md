In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll cover building a basic dashboard application with Cube.js and the most popular library for visualizing dataâ€”D3.js. Although Cube.js doesnâ€™t provide a visualization layer itself, it is very easy to integrate with any existing charting library.

You can check [the online demo of this dashboard here](http://d3-dashboard-demo.cube.dev/) and [the complete source code of the example app is available on Github](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/tree/master/examples/d3-dashboard).

We are going to use Postgres to store our data. Cube.js will connect to it and act as a middleware between the database and the client, providing API, abstraction, caching, and a lot more. On the frontend, weâ€™ll have React with Material UI and D3 for chart rendering. Below, you can find a schema of the whole architecture of the example app.
