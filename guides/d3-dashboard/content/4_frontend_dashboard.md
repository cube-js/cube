title: "Building a Frontend Dashboard"
---

Now we are ready to build our frontend application. We’re going to use Cube.js Templates, which is a scaffolding engine for quickly creating frontend applications configured to work with the Cube.js backend. It provides a selection of different frontend frameworks, UI kits, and charting libraries to mix together. We’ll pick React, Material UI, and D3.js. Let’s navigate to the Dashboard App tab and create a new dashboard application.

It could take several minutes to generate an app and install all the dependencies. Once it is done, you will have a `dashboard-app` folder inside your Cube.js project folder. To start a frontend application, either go to the “Dashboard App” tab in the playground and hit the “Start” button, or run the following command inside the dashboard-app folder:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Make sure the Cube.js backend process is up and running since our frontend application uses its API. The frontend application is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you open it in your browser, you should be able to see an empty dashboard.

To add a chart to the dashboard, we can either build it in the playground and click the “add to dashboard” button or edit the `src/pages/DashboardPage.js` file in the `dashboard-app` folder. Let’s go with the latter option. Among other things, this file declares the `DashboardItems` variable, which is an array of queries for charts.

Edit `dashboard-app/src/pages/DashboardPage.js` to add charts to the dashboard.


```diff
-const DashboardItems = [];
+const DashboardItems = [
+  {
+    id: 0,
+    name: "Orders last 14 days",
+    vizState: {
+      query: {
+        measures: ["Orders.count"],
+        timeDimensions: [
+          {
+            dimension: "Orders.createdAt",
+            granularity: "day",
+            dateRange: "last 14 days"
+          }
+        ],
+        filters: []
+      },
+      chartType: "line"
+    }
+  },
+  {
+    id: 1,
+    name: "Orders Status by Customers City",
+    vizState: {
+      query: {
+        measures: ["Orders.count"],
+        dimensions: ["Users.city", "Orders.status"],
+        timeDimensions: [
+          {
+            dimension: "Orders.createdAt",
+            dateRange: "last year"
+          }
+        ]
+      },
+      chartType: "bar",
+      pivotConfig: {
+        x: ["Users.city"],
+        y: ["Orders.status", "measures"]
+      }
+    }
+  },
+  {
+    id: 3,
+    name: "Orders by Product Categories Over Time",
+    vizState: {
+      query: {
+        measures: ["Orders.count"],
+        timeDimensions: [
+          {
+            dimension: "Orders.createdAt",
+            granularity: "month",
+            dateRange: "last year"
+          }
+        ],
+        dimensions: ["ProductCategories.name"]
+      },
+      chartType: "area"
+    }
+  },
+  {
+    id: 3,
+    name: "Orders by Price Range",
+    vizState: {
+      query: {
+        measures: ["Orders.count"],
+        filters: [
+          {
+            "dimension": "Orders.price",
+            "operator": "set"
+          }
+        ],
+        dimensions: ["Orders.priceRange"]
+      },
+      chartType: "pie"
+    }
+  }
+];
```

As you can see above, we’ve just added an array of Cube.js query objects.

If you refresh the dashboard, you should be able to see your charts!

You can notice that one of our queries have the `pivotConfig` defined as the following.

```javascript
  pivotConfig: {
    x: ["Users.city"],
    y: ["Orders.status", "measures"]
  }
```

As I mentioned in the previous chapter the default value for `pivotConfig` usually works fine, but in some cases like this one, we need to adjust it to get the desired result. We want to plot a bar here with the cities on the X-Axis and the number of orders on the Y-Axis grouped by the orders' statuses. That is exactly what we are passing here in the `pivotConfig`: `Users.city` to the X-Axis and measures with `Orders.status` to the Y-axis to get the grouped result.

To customize the rendering of the charts, you can edit the `dashboard-app/src/pages/ChartRenderer.js` file. It should look familiar to what we saw in the previous chapter.

You can check the online demo of this dashboard here and the complete source code of the example is available on Github here.
