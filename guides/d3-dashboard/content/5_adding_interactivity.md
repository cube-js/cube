title: "Adding Interactivity"

In this chapter, we'll add a filter to our dashboard to make it more interactive.
The filter will allow users to look at specific sets of orders based on their
status: processing, completed, or shipped.

Cube.js makes it easy to add such dynamic features because we don't need to add anything to our data schema. We
already have a dimension, `Orders.status`, and we can just filter by this
dimension by adding filters properties to our JSON query.

Say we have the following query, which is used to plot an area chart with the number
of orders over time grouped by the product category.

```javascript
{
  measures: ["Orders.count"],
  timeDimensions: [
    {
      dimension: "Orders.createdAt",
      granularity: "month",
      dateRange: "last year"
    }
  ],
  dimensions: ["ProductCategories.name"]
}
```

To load only completed orders with this query, we need to add a filters property
to it.

```javascript
{
  measures: ["Orders.count"],
  timeDimensions: [
    {
      dimension: "Orders.createdAt",
      granularity: "month",
      dateRange: "last year"
    }
  ],
  filters: [
    {
      member: "Orders.status",
      operator: "equals",
      values: ["completed"]
    }
  ],
  dimensions: ["ProductCategories.name"]
}
```

You can learn about all the filters operators in the [query format
docs](https://cube.dev/docs/query-format#filters-operators).

So all we need to do to make the filter work is to conditionally add this
filters property to all our dashboard queries. To do this, let's introduce the
`dashboardItemsWithFilter` method in `dashboard-app/src/pages/DashboardPage.js`.
In this method, we check if the filter value s any other rather than "all" we inject the filters
property with the corresponding filter value to all the queries.

```javascript
const dashboardItemsWithFilter = (dashboardItems, statusFilter) => {
  if (statusFilter === "all") {
    return dashboardItems;
  }

  const statusFilterObj = {
    member: "Orders.status",
    operator: "equals",
    values: [statusFilter]
  };

  return dashboardItems.map(({ vizState, ...dashboardItem }) => (
    {
      ...dashboardItem,
      vizState: {
        ...vizState,
        query: {
          ...vizState.query,
          filters: (vizState.query.filters || []).concat(statusFilterObj),
        },
      }
    }
  ))
};
```

Now, we need to render the user input for the filter. We can use the `<ButtonGroup />` component from the Material UI kit for this and render a button per the possible state of the order plus the "All" button. We'll use the React `useState` hook to store and update the filter value.


First make sure to import `useState` and the required components from Material UI.

```diff
-import React from "react";
+import React, { useState } from "react";
+import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
+import ButtonGroup from '@material-ui/core/ButtonGroup';
```

Next, we render the buttons group and change the value of the `statusFilter`
on the button's click. Note that we use the newly created `dashboardItemsWithFilter` method to
iterate over dashboard items for rendering.

```diff
-  return DashboardItems.length ? (
-    <Dashboard>{DashboardItems.map(dashboardItem)}</Dashboard>
-  ) : (
+  const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState("all");
+  return DashboardItems.length ? ([
+    <ButtonGroup style={{ padding: "24px 24px 0 24px" }} color="primary">
+      {["all", "processing", "completed", "shipped"].map(value => (
+        <Button
+          variant={value === statusFilter ? "contained" : ""}
+          onClick={() => setStatusFilter(value)}>
+          {value.toUpperCase()}
+        </Button>
+      ))}
+    </ButtonGroup>,
+    <Dashboard>
+      {dashboardItemsWithFilter(DashboardItems, statusFilter).map(dashboardItem)}
+    </Dashboard>
+  ]) : (
```

That is all we need to create a simple filter and make our D3 dashboard dynamic
and interactive.
