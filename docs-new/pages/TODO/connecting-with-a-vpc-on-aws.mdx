# Connecting with a VPC on AWS
To connect with a VPC on AWS, you need to collect the necessary information and
hand it over to your Cube Cloud representative. Next, you'll have to accept a
VPC peering request sent by Cube Cloud. Finally, you'll need to configure
security groups and route tables to ensure Cube Cloud can connect to your data
source.

## Prerequisites

To allow Cube Cloud to connect to a [VPC on AWS][aws-docs-vpc], the following
information is required:

- **AWS Account ID:** The AWS account ID of the VPC owner. This can be found in
  the top-right corner of [the AWS Console][aws-console].
- **AWS Region:** [The AWS region][aws-docs-regions] that the VPC resides in.
  Ensure that the region is available in [Supported Regions](#supported-regions)
  to see if Cube Cloud VPC connectivity is available in your region.
- **AWS VPC ID:** The ID of the VPC that Cube Cloud will connect to, for
  example, `vpc-0099aazz`
- **AWS VPC CIDR:** The [CIDR block][wiki-cidr-block] of the VPC that Cube Cloud
  will connect to, for example, `10.0.0.0/16`

After receiving the above information, a Customer Success Manager will provide
you with the **AWS account ID**, **region**, **VPC ID** and the [**CIDR
block**][wiki-cidr-block] used by Cube Cloud to connect to your VPC.

## Setup

###  VPC Peering Request

After receiving the information above, Cube Cloud will send a [VPC peering
request][aws-docs-vpc-peering] that must be accepted. This can be done either
through the [AWS Web Console][aws-console] or through an infrastructure-as-code
tool.

To [accept the VPC peering request][aws-docs-vpc-peering-accept] through the AWS
Web Console, follow the instructions below:

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

  <WarningBox>

    Ensure you have the necessary permissions to accept a VPC peering request. If
    you are unsure, please contact your AWS administrator.

  </WarningBox>

2. Use the Region selector to choose the Region of the accepter VPC.

3. In the navigation pane, choose <Btn>Peering connections</Btn>.

4. Select the pending VPC peering connection (the status should be
   `pending-acceptance`), then choose <Btn>Actions</Btn>, followed by&nbsp;
   &ZeroWidthSpace;<Btn>Accept request</Btn>.

  <WarningBox>

    Ensure the peering request is from Cube Cloud by checking that the **AWS account
    ID**, **region** and **VPC IDs** match those provided by your CSM.

  </WarningBox>

5. When prompted for confirmation, choose <Btn>Accept request</Btn>.

6. Choose <Btn>Modify my route tables now</Btn> to add a route to the VPC route
   table so that you can send and receive traffic across the peering connection.

<InfoBox>

For more information about peering connection lifecycle statuses, check out the
[VPC peering connection lifecycle on AWS][aws-docs-vpc-peering-lifecycle].

</InfoBox>

###  Updating security groups

The initial VPC setup will not allow traffic from Cube Cloud; this is because
[the security group][aws-docs-vpc-security-group] for the database will need to
allow access from the Cube Cloud CIDR block.

This can be achieved by adding a new security group rule:

| Protocol | Port Range | Source/Destination                            |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| TCP      | 3306       | The Cube Cloud CIDR block for the AWS region. |

###  Update route tables

The final step is to update route tables in your VPC to allow traffic from Cube
Cloud to reach your database. The Cube Cloud CIDR block must be added to the
route tables of all subnets that connect to the database. To do this, follow the
instructions on [the AWS documentation][aws-docs-vpc-peering-routing].

## Troubleshooting

Database connection issues with misconfigured VPCs often manifest as connection
timeouts. If you are experiencing connection issues, please check the following:

- Verify that
  [all security groups allow traffic](#setup-updating-security-groups) from the
  Cube Cloud provided CIDR block.
- Verify that
  [a route exists to the Cube Cloud provided CIDR block](#setup-update-route-tables)
  from the subnets that connect to the database.
