# Generate data models
In this step, you will generate data models using the connected data source from
the last step.

Cube's data models provide a declarative way to define important facts about
your data and relationships between them. You can create data models from
scratch or let Cube generate an initial version for you.

## Select tables

Start by selecting the database tables to generate the data models from, then
click <Btn>Measures and Dimensions</Btn>:

/>

## Measures and dimensions

Next, you'll see all detected measures and dimensions from the data source.
Click <Btn>Primary Keys</Btn> to progress to the next step:

## Primary keys

Review the detected primary keys for each cube and click <Btn>Joins</Btn> to
move to the next step:

## Joins

Once again, review the detected joins and relationships and
click&nbsp;<Btn>Review</Btn>:

## Review

The last screen allows you to review all the detected cubes and their
corresponding measures, dimensions, and joins. If everything looks good, pick
either <Btn>YAML</Btn> (recommended) or <Btn>JavaScript</Btn> format and
click&nbsp;<Btn>Confirm & Generate</Btn>:

Cube Cloud will now generate the models and spin up your Cube deployment, and in
a few moments you should see the following screen:
