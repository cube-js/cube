Simba Spark JDBC Driver with SQL Connector Release Notes 
==============================================================================

The release notes provide details of enhancements, features, known issues, and
workflow changes in Simba Spark JDBC Driver with SQL Connector 2.6.17.

For information about upcoming support deprecations or removals, see the 
Workflow Changes section. Deprecated features will not receive any updates,
but will continue to be usable in their current state until support is removed
in a future release.


2.6.17 =======================================================================

Released 2020-10-23 

Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Spark JDBC Driver 2.6.17.

 * [SPARKJ-328] In some cases, non-row count queries result in the driver 
   returning an incorrect error.
 
 * [SPARKJ-336][SPARKJ-353] In some cases, the user-agent entry validation
   logic rejects valid user-agent entry strings.

 * [SPARKJ-348] The driver does not honor the values set via the
   Statement.setFetchSize JDBC API call. 
    
 * [SPARKJ-406] The driver does not return the correct row count result when 
   it is provided by the server.


Known Issues 
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in 
the data source, the driver, or an application. 

 * [SPARKJ-330] Issue with date and timestamp before the beginning of the 
   Gregorian calendar when connecting to Spark 2.4.4 or later, or versions 
   previous to 3.0, with Arrow result set serialization.
 
   When using Spark 2.4.4 or later, or versions previous to Spark 3.0, DATE 
   and TIMESTAMP data before October 15, 1582 may be returned incorrectly if 
   the server supports serializing query results using Apache Arrow. This 
   issue should not impact most distributions of Apache Spark.

   To confirm if your distribution of Spark 2.4.4 or later has been impacted 
   by this issue, you can execute the following query:

   SELECT DATE '1581-10-14'

   If the result returned by the driver is 1581-10-24, then you are impacted 
   by the issue. In this case, if your data set contains date and/or timestamp
   data earlier than October 15, 1582, you can work around this issue by 
   adding EnableArrow=0 in your connection URL to disable the Arrow result set
   serialization feature. 


Workflow Changes =============================================================

The following changes may disrupt established workflows for the driver. 

In addition to changes that are already implemented in the current version of 
the driver, this section describes potentially disruptive changes that will be 
implemented in a future version of the driver, so that you can plan 
accordingly.

   format.
   

Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Spark JDBC Driver 2.6.14.

 * [SPARKJ-325][SPARKJ-326] When TransportMode is set to http and AuthMech,

2.6.13 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2020-05-08
   
Enhancements & New Features

 * [SPARKJ-243] Improved connection efficiency
 
   The driver now only opens one session per connection, as long as the server
   provides sufficient information during the initial OpenSession call.
   Previously, the driver opened two sessions per connection in order to
   retrieve the required server information. 

 * [SPARKJ-261] Improved metadata operations

 * [SPARKJ-331] Removed driver name spaces in the user-agent string
 
   The driver now sends the user-agent string as
   "SimbaSparkJDBCDriver/<driver version>". Previously, it was sent as "Simba
   Spark JDBCDriver/<driver version>".

 * [SPARKJ-332] Support for Java 11
 
   The driver now supports Java 11.


Resolved Issues

   HTTP header are not displayed.
   
 * [SPARKJ-339] A newer, unrecognized server protocol version triggers the 
   driver to fallback to the lowest known version.

Released 2020-03-20
   
Enhancements & New Features

 * [SPARKJ-239][SPARKJ-241] Improved handling for HTTP 503 and HTTP 429 
   responses 

   The driver now returns more informative error messages when the server 
   returns an HTTP 503 or HTTP 429 response. 

   Additionally, you can now configure the driver to retry the operation that 
   caused the response if the server returned Retry-After headers along with 
   the response. To do this, set the following new properties:
   - For HTTP 503 responses: ClusterAutostartRetry and 
     ClusterAutostartRetryTimeout
   - For HTTP 429 responses: RateLimitRetry and RateLimitRetryTimeout

   For more information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * [SPARKJ-240] User agent entry in HTTP request

   The driver now supports the use of a user agent entry in HTTP requests. 
   You can set the new UserAgentEntry property to the user agent entry. For 
   more information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * [SPARKJ-257] Improved data retrieval performance

   The driver now uses fewer server round-trips to query and retrieve data 
   when connected to a server that supports the required wire protocol 
   improvements.

 * [SPARKJ-312] Session tagging

   When connecting to certain distributions of Spark, the driver sends an 
   additional header. This header contains a unique identifier that 
   corresponds to the current session. 

 * [SPARKJ-313] HTTP 4xx/5xx error messages

   When connecting to certain distributions of Spark, the driver now displays 
   an error message for all HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses, if such an error 
   message is provided by the server.


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Spark JDBC Driver 2.6.12.

 * [SPARKJ-310] When you use the driver with the Denodo application, it 
   returns the following error: "Could not initialize Class".

   executed in a multi-threaded environment, the driver throws an Index Out 
   Of Bound exception.

 * [SPARKJ-319] SQL statements using the EXISTS predicate return an error.

 * [SPARKJ-322] The driver returns incorrect results for decimal columns.
