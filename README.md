__Cube is the headless business intelligence platform.__ It helps data engineers and application developers to access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application.

Cube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources including cloud data warehouses (CDWs) like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

For more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction) page in our documentation. 

## Why Cube?

If you are building your data application, most probably you'll face the following problems:

1. __SQL code organization.__ Modeling even a dozen of metrics with a dozen of dimensions using pure SQL queries sooner or later becomes a maintenance nightmare which ends up in building modelling framework.
2. __Performance.__ Most of effort time in modern analytics software development is spent to provide adequate time to insight. In the world where every company data is a big data writing just SQL query to get insight isn't enough anymore.
3. __Access Control.__ It is important to secure and govern access to data from all the downstream data consuming applications.

Cube has necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control and performance optiomizations so every application like embedded analytics, dashboarding and reporting tools, data notebooks and other tools can access consistent data via REST, SQL, and GraphQL APIs.

## Getting Started üöÄ

The fastest way to try Cube locally is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Once Docker is installed, in a new folder for your project, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  -e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \
  cubejs/cube
```

And then open http://localhost:4000 in your browser to continue set up. You can learn more by following our [Getting started](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started-docker) guide.

Alternatively, if you have Node.js installed, you can run this command and follow the [Getting Started](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started) guide.

```
$ npx cubejs-cli create hello-world
```
