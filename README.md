__Cube is the headless business intelligence platform.__ It helps data engineers and application developers access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application.

Cube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

For more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction?ref=github-readme) page in our documentation. 

## Why Cube?

If you are building a data application—such as a business intelligence tool or a customer-facing analytics feature—you’ll probably face the following problems:

1. __SQL code organization.__ Sooner or later, modeling even a dozen metrics with a dozen dimensions using pure SQL queries becomes a maintenance nightmare, which leads to building a modeling framework.
2. __Performance.__ Most of the time and effort in modern analytics software development is spent providing adequate time to insight. In a world where every company’s data is big data, writing just SQL queries to get insight isn’t enough anymore.
3. __Access Control.__ It is important to secure and govern access to data for all downstream data consuming applications.

Cube has the necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control, and performance optimizations so that every application—like embedded analytics, dashboarding and reporting tools, data notebooks, and other tools—can access consistent data via REST, SQL, and GraphQL APIs.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Cube Cloud

[Cube Cloud](https://cube.dev/cloud?ref=github-readme) is the fastest way to get started with Cube. It provides managed infrastructure as well as an instant and free access for development projects and proofs of concept.

<a href="https://cubecloud.dev/auth/signup?ref=github-readme"><img src="https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/f1f1eac0-0b44-4c47-936e-33b5c06eedf0.png" alt="Get started now" width="200px"></a>

For a step-by-step guide on Cube Cloud, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/cloud/getting-started/create?ref=github-readme).

### Docker

Alternatively, you can get started with Cube locally or self-host it with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Once Docker is installed, in a new folder for your project, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  -e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \
  cubejs/cube
```

Then, open http://localhost:4000 in your browser to continue setup.

For a step-by-step guide on Docker, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started-docker?ref=github-readme).
