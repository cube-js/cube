__Cube.js is an open-source analytical API platform.__ It is primarily used to build internal business intelligence tools or add customer-facing analytics to existing applications.

Cube.js was designed to work with serverless data warehouses and query engines like Google BigQuery and AWS Athena. A multi-stage querying approach makes it suitable for handling
trillions of data points. Most modern RDBMS work with Cube.js as well and can be
further tuned for performance.

For more details, see the [Cube.js introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction) page in our documentation. 

## Why Cube.js?

If you are building your own business intelligence tool or customer-facing analytics most probably you'll face the following problems:

1. __Performance.__ Most of effort time in modern analytics software development is spent to provide adequate time to insight. In the world where every company data is a big data writing just SQL query to get insight isn't enough anymore.
2. __SQL code organization.__ Modelling even a dozen of metrics with a dozen of dimensions using pure SQL queries sooner or later becomes a maintenance nightmare which ends up in building modelling framework.
3. __Infrastructure.__ Key components every production-ready analytics solution requires: analytic SQL generation, query results caching and execution orchestration, data pre-aggregation, security, API for query results fetch, and visualization.

Cube.js has necessary infrastructure for every analytic application that heavily relies on its caching and pre-aggregation layer to provide several minutes raw data to insight delay and sub second API response times on a trillion of data points scale.

## Getting Started üöÄ

There're two ways to create a Cube.js application.

If you have Node.js installed, run this command and follow with the [Getting Started](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started) guide.

```
$ npx cubejs-cli create hello-world
```

In case you don't have Node.js, or you'd like to run Cube.js with Docker, have a look at the [Getting started with Docker](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started-docker) guide.
