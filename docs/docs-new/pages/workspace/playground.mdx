# Playground
Playground is a web-based tool which allows executing queries and previewing their results.

<SuccessBox>

Playground is available in Cube Cloud on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

Cube Core and Cube Cloud both provide the Playground experience; however, a few additional features are available in Cube Cloud.

## Running Playground

### Cube Core

Playground is available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) when Cube is run in
[development mode][ref-dev-mode], i.e., when `CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` is set to `true`.

<WarningBox>

Since Playground exposes all data models and allows running all possible
queries, it should not be used in production. You can use
the [JavaScript SDKs](/frontend-introduction) to build your own query builder and
use it to query your Cube API in a secure way.

</WarningBox>

### Cube Cloud

Playground is available out of the box to authenticated [Cube Cloud][cube-cloud] users.

When editing the data model through the [Cube
IDE][ref-devtools-ide], Playground will switch to the Development API and its status will be visible in
the Playground:

## Query tabs

You can use query tabs to keep results of previous queries while still being
able to make new queries. The query tabs can be found at the top of the
Developer Playground:

## Editing the Security Context

The security context used for queries can be modified by clicking&nbsp;<Btn>Add
Security Context</Btn>:

You can paste in an existing JWT if desired; or create a brand-new one by
providing a JSON object that represents the decoded JWT.
