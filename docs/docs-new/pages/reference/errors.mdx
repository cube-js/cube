# Error message reference

Working with Cube, you might encounter various error messages in logs and API responses.
This page lists some of them with some practical advice on mitigation.

## `Can't find join path`

```
Can't find join path to join 'cube_a', 'cube_b'
```

Error message above indicates that a query failed because it includes members from cubes
that can't be joined in order to generate a valid query to the upstream data source.

**Please check that you've defined necessary [joins](/product/data-modeling/reference/joins)
and that they have [correct directions](/product/data-modeling/fundamentals/working-with-joins#transitive-join-pitfalls).**

Also, please consider using [views](/product/data-modeling/reference/view) since they
incapsulate join paths and completely remove the possibility of the error in question.
You might also consider setting [`public: false`](/product/data-modeling/reference/cube#public)
on your cubes to hide them from end users.

If youâ€™re building a custom data application, you might use the [`meta` endpoint](/reference/rest-api#v1meta)
of the REST API. It groups cubes into `connectedComponents` to help select those ones
that can be joined together.
