# Error message reference

Working with Cube, you might encounter various error messages in logs and API responses.
This page lists some of them with some practical advice on mitigation.

## `Can't find join path`

```
Can't find join path to join 'cube_a', 'cube_b'
```

Error message above indicates that a query failed because it includes members from cubes
that can't be joined in order to generate a valid query to the upstream data source.

**Please check that you've defined necessary [joins](/product/data-modeling/reference/joins)
and that they have [correct directions](/product/data-modeling/fundamentals/working-with-joins#transitive-join-pitfalls).**

Also, please consider using [views](/product/data-modeling/reference/view) since they
incapsulate join paths and completely remove the possibility of the error in question.
You might also consider setting [`public: false`](/product/data-modeling/reference/cube#public)
on your cubes to hide them from end users.

If youâ€™re building a custom data application, you might use the [`meta` endpoint](/reference/rest-api#v1meta)
of the REST API. It groups cubes into `connectedComponents` to help select those ones
that can be joined together.

## `Primary key is required when join is defined`

```
cube_a cube: primary key for 'cube_a' is required when join is defined
in order to make aggregates work properly
```

Error message above indicates that you have a [cube](/product/data-modeling/reference/cube)
with [joins](/product/data-modeling/reference/joins) and
[pre-aggregations](/product/data-modeling/reference/pre-aggregations). However, that cube
doesn't have a primary key.

When generating SQL queries, Cube uses primary keys to avoid fanouts.
A fanout happens when two tables are joined and a single value gets duplicated in the end result,
meaning that some values can be double counted. 

**Please define a [primary key](/product/data-modeling/reference/dimensions#primary_key) dimension in this cube to make joins and pre-aggregations work correctly.**

If your data doesn't have a natural primary key, e.g., `id`, you can define a composite
primary key by concatenating most or all of the columns in the table, e.g.:


```yml
cubes:
  - name: cube_a
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: composite_key
        sql: CONCAT(column_a, '-', column_b, '-', column_c)
        type: string
        primary_key: true
```
