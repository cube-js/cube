# Implementing Schema Generation

This functionality only works with data models written in JavaScript, not YAML.

Cube supports two ways to define data model files: with YAML or JavaScript
syntax. If you opt for JavaScript syntax, you can use the full power of this
programming language to configure your data model. In this guide we generate
several measure definitions based on an array of strings.

One example, based on a real world scenario, is when you have a single `events`
table containing an `event_type` and `user_id` column. Based on this table you
want to create a separate user count measure for each event.

It can be done as simple as

```javascript
const events = ['app_engagement', 'login', 'purchase'];

cube(`events`, {
  sql_table: `events`,

  measures: Object.assign(
    {
      count: {
        type: `count`,
      },
    },
    events
      .map((e) => ({
        [`${e}_user_count`]: {
          type: `count_distinct`,
          sql: `user_id`,
          filters: [
            {
              sql: `${CUBE}.event_type = '${e}'`,
            },
          ],
        },
      }))
      .reduce((a, b) => Object.assign(a, b))
  ),
});
```

In this case we use standard Javascript functions
[`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign),
[`Array.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
and
[`Array.reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
to add user count measure definitions based on `events` array. This approach
allows you to maintain list of events in very concise manner without boilerplate
code. This configuration can be reused using
[export / import feature](export-import).

Please refer to the
[`asyncModule()`](/schema/reference/execution-environment#async-module)
documentation to learn how to use databases and other data sources for data
model generation.
