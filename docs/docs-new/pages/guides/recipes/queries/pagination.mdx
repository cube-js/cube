# Implementing pagination

## Use case

We want to display a table of data with hundreds of rows. To make the table
easier to digest and to improve the performance of the query, we'll use
pagination. With the recipe below, we'll get the orders list sorted by the order
number. Every page will have 5 orders.

## Data modeling

We have the following data model:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql_table: orders

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: number
        sql: number
        type: number

      - name: created_at
        sql: created_at
        type: time
```

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    number: {
      sql: `number`,
      type: `number`,
    },

    created_at: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

## Query

To select orders that belong to a particular page, we can use the `limit` and
`offset` query properties. First, let's get the number of all orders that we have.

```json
{
  "measures": [
    "orders.count"
  ]
}
```

Then, let's retrieve first batch (page) of five orders:

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    "orders.number"
  ],
  "order": {
    "orders.number": "asc"
  },
  "limit": 5
}
```

Now, let's retrieve the second batch (page) of five orders:

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    "orders.number"
  ],
  "order": {
    "orders.number": "asc"
  },
  "limit": 5,
  "offset": 5
}
```

## Result

We have received five orders per query and can use them as we want.

```javascript
// Orders count:

[
  {
    'orders.count': '10000',
  },
];
```

```javascript
// The first five orders:

[
  {
    'orders.number': 1,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 2,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 3,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 4,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 5,
  },
];
```

```javascript
// The next five orders:

[
  {
    'orders.number': 6,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 7,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 8,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 9,
  },
  {
    'orders.number': 10,
  },
];
```
