# Enforcing role-based access

## Use case

We want to manage user access to different data depending on their role. In the
recipe below, a user with the `operator` role can only view processing orders
from a shop and a `manager` can only view shipped and completed orders.

## Configuration

To implement role-based access, we will use a
[JSON Web Token](https://cube.dev/docs/security) with role information in the
payload, and the
[`queryRewrite`](https://cube.dev/docs/security/context#using-query-rewrite)
extension point to manage data access.

Let's add the role verification in the `cube.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    if (!securityContext.role) {
      throw new Error('No role found in Security Context!');
    }

    if (securityContext.role == 'manager') {
      query.filters.push({
        member: 'orders.status',
        operator: 'equals',
        values: ['shipped', 'completed'],
      });
    }

    if (securityContext.role == 'operator') {
      query.filters.push({
        member: 'orders.status',
        operator: 'equals',
        values: ['processing'],
      });
    }

    return query;
  },
};
```

## Query

To get the number of orders as a manager or operator, we will send two identical
requests with different JWTs:

```json
{
  "iat": 1000000000,
  "exp": 5000000000,
  "role": "manager"
}
```

```json
{
  "iat": 1000000000,
  "exp": 5000000000,
  "role": "operator"
}
```

## Result

We have received different data depending on the user's role.

```json5
// Manager
[
  {
    "orders.status": "completed",
    "orders.count": "3346"
  },
  {
    "orders.status": "shipped",
    "orders.count": "3300"
  }
]
```

```json5
// Operator
[
  {
    "orders.status": "processing",
    "orders.count": "3354"
  }
]
```
