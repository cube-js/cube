# Using originalSql and rollup pre-aggregations effectively

## Use case

For cubes that are built from an expensive SQL query, we can optimize
pre-aggregation builds so that they don't have to re-run the SQL query.

## Configuration

We can do this by creating a pre-aggregation of type
[`originalSql`][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-type-origsql] on the source (also known
as internal) database, and then configuring our existing `rollup`
pre-aggregations to use the `originalSql` pre-aggregation with the
[`useOriginalSqlPreAggregations` property][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-use-origsql].

<WarningBox>

Storing pre-aggregations on an internal database requires write-access. Please
ensure that your database driver is not configured with `readOnly: true`.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: "<YOUR_EXPENSIVE_SQL_QUERY HERE>"

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: base
        type: original_sql
        external: false
      - name: main
        dimensions:
          - id
          - name
        measures:
          - count
        time_dimension: created_at
        granularity: day
        use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true
```

```javascript
cube("orders", {
  sql: `<YOUR_EXPENSIVE_SQL_QUERY HERE>`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    base: {
      type: `original_sql`,
      external: false,
    },

    main: {
      dimensions: [id, name],
      measures: [count],
      time_dimension: created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true,
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

</CodeTabs>

## Result

With the above data model, the `main` pre-aggregation is built from the `base`
pre-aggregation.
