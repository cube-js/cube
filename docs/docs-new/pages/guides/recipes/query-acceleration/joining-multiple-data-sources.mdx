# Joining data from multiple data sources

## Use case

Let's imagine we store information about products and their suppliers in
separate databases. We want to aggregate data from these data sources while
having decent performance. In the recipe below, we'll learn how to create a
[rollup join](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/pre-aggregations#parameters-type-rollupjoin)
between two databases to achieve our goal.

## Configuration

First of all, we should define our database connections with the `dataSource`
option in the `cube.js` configuration file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  driverFactory: ({ dataSource }) => {
    if (dataSource === 'suppliers') {
      return {
        type: 'postgres',
        database: 'recipes',
        host: 'demo-db-recipes.cube.dev',
        user: 'cube',
        password: '12345',
        port: '5432',
      };
    }

    if (dataSource === 'products') {
      return {
        type: 'postgres',
        database: 'ecom',
        host: 'demo-db-recipes.cube.dev',
        user: 'cube',
        password: '12345',
        port: '5432',
      };
    }

    throw new Error('dataSource is undefined');
  },
};
```

## Data modeling

First, we'll define
[rollup](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/pre-aggregations#parameters-type-rollup)
pre-aggregations for `products` and `suppliers`. Note that these pre-aggregations should
contain the dimension on which they're joined. In this case, it's the `supplier_id`
dimension in the `products` cube, and the `id` dimension in the `suppliers` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: products
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: products_rollup
        type: rollup
        dimensions:
          - name
          - supplier_id
        indexes:
          category_index:
            columns:
              - supplier_id

    joins:
      suppliers:
        sql: "{supplier_id} = ${suppliers.id}"
        relationship: many_to_one
```

```javascript
cube('products', {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    products_rollup: {
      type: `rollup`,
      dimensions: [name, supplier_id],
      indexes: {
        category_index: {
          columns: [supplier_id],
        }
      }
    },
  },

  joins: {
    suppliers: {
      sql: `${supplier_id} = ${suppliers.id}`,
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
    },
  },

  // ...
})
```

</CodeTabs>

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: suppliers
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: suppliers_rollup
        type: rollup
        dimensions:
          - id
          - company
          - email
        indexes:
          category_index:
            columns:
              - id
```

```javascript
cube('suppliers', {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    suppliers_rollup: {
      type: `rollup`,
      dimensions: [id, company, email],
      indexes: {
        category_index: {
          columns: [id],
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

Then, we'll also define a `rollup_join` pre-aggregation in the `products` cube, which will enable
aggregating data from multiple data sources:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: products
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: combined_rollup
        type: rollup_join
        dimensions:
          - suppliers.email
          - suppliers.company
          - name
        rollups:
          - suppliers.suppliers_rollup
          - products_rollup
```

```javascript
cube('products', {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    combined_rollup: {
      type: `rollup_join`,
      dimensions: [suppliers.email, suppliers.company, name],
      rollups: [suppliers.suppliers_rollup, products_rollup],
    }
  }
});
```

</CodeTabs>

## Query

Let's get the product names and their suppliers' info, such as company name and
email, with the following query:

```json
{
  "order": {
    "products.name": "asc"
  },
  "dimensions": [
    "products.name",
    "suppliers.company",
    "suppliers.email"
  ],
  "limit": 3
}
```

## Result

We'll get the data from two pre-aggregations joined into one `rollup_join`:

```json
[
  {
    "products.name": "Awesome Cotton Sausages",
    "suppliers.company": "Justo Eu Arcu Inc.",
    "suppliers.email": "id.risus@luctuslobortisClass.net"
  },
  {
    "products.name": "Awesome Fresh Keyboard",
    "suppliers.company": "Quisque Purus Sapien Limited",
    "suppliers.email": "Cras@consectetuercursuset.co.uk"
  },
  {
    "products.name": "Awesome Rubber Soap",
    "suppliers.company": "Tortor Inc.",
    "suppliers.email": "Mauris@ac.com"
  }
]
```
