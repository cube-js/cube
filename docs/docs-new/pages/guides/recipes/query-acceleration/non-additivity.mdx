# Accelerating non-additive measures

## Use case

We want to run queries against
[pre-aggregations](/product/caching#pre-aggregations) only to ensure our
application's superior performance. Usually, accelerating a query is as simple
as including its measures and dimensions to the pre-aggregation
[definition](/product/data-modeling/reference/pre-aggregations#measures).

[Non-additive](/product/caching/getting-started-pre-aggregations#ensuring-pre-aggregations-are-targeted-by-queries-non-additivity)
measures (e.g., average values or distinct counts) are a special case.
Pre-aggregations with such measures are less likely to be
[selected](/product/caching/getting-started-pre-aggregations#ensuring-pre-aggregations-are-targeted-by-queries-selecting-the-pre-aggregation)
to accelerate a query. However, there are a few ways to work around that.

## Data modeling

Let's explore the `users` cube that contains various measures describing users'
age:

- count of unique age values (`distinct_ages`)
- average age (`avg_age`)
- 90th [percentile](/guides/recipes/data-modeling/percentiles) of age
  (`p90_age`)

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: distinct_ages
        sql: age
        type: count_distinct

      - name: avg_age
        sql: age
        type: avg

      - name: p90_age
        sql: PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY age)
        type: number
```

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  measures: {
    distinct_ages: {
      sql: `age`,
      type: `count_distinct`,
    },

    avg_age: {
      sql: `age`,
      type: `avg`,
    },

    p90_age: {
      sql: `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY age)`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

All of these measures are non-additive. Practically speaking, it means that the
pre-aggregation below would only accelerate a query that fully matches its
definition:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - distinct_ages
          - avg_age
          - p90_age
        dimensions:
          - gender
```

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...
  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [distinct_ages, avg_age, p90_age],
      dimensions: [gender],
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

This query will match the pre-aggregation above and, thus, will be accelerated:

```json
{
  "measures": ["users.distinct_ages", "users.avg_age", "users.p90_age"],
  "dimensions": ["users.gender"]
}
```

Meanwhile, the query below won't match the same pre-aggregation because it
contains non-additive measures and omits the `gender` dimension. It won't be
accelerated:

```json
{
  "measures": ["users.distinct_ages", "users.avg_age", "users.p90_age"]
}
```

Let's explore some possible workarounds.

### Replacing with approximate additive measures

Often, non-additive `count_distinct` measures can be changed to have the
[`count_distinct_approx` type](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#count_distinct_approx)
which will make them additive and orders of magnitude more performant. This
`count_distinct_approx` measures can be used in pre-aggregations. However, there
are two drawbacks:

- This type is approximate, so the measures might yield slightly different
  results compared to their `count_distinct` counterparts. Please consult with
  your database's documentation to learn more.
- The `count_distinct_approx` is not supported with all databases. Currently,
  Cube supports it for Athena, BigQuery, and Snowflake.

For example, the `distinct_ages` measure can be rewritten as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users

    measures:
      - name: distinct_ages
        sql: age
        type: count_distinct_approx
```

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  measures: {
    distinct_ages: {
      sql: `age`,
      type: `count_distinct_approx`,
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

### Decomposing into a formula with additive measures

Non-additive `avg` measures can be rewritten as
[calculated measures](/product/data-modeling/reference/measures#calculated-measures)
that reference additive measures only. Then, this additive measures can be used
in pre-aggregations. Please note, however, that you shouldn't include `avg_age`
measure in your pre-aggregation as it renders it non-additive.

For example, the `avg_age` measure can be rewritten as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users

    measures:
      - name: avg_age
        sql: "{age_sum} / {count}"
        type: number

      - name: age_sum
        sql: age
        type: sum

      - name: count
        type: count

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - age_sum
          - count
        dimensions:
          - gender
```

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  measures: {
    avg_age: {
      sql: `${age_sum} / ${count}`,
      type: `number`,
    },

    age_sum: {
      sql: `age`,
      type: `sum`,
    },

    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [age_sum, count],
      dimensions: [gender],
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

### Providing multiple pre-aggregations

If the two workarounds described above don't apply to your use case, feel free
to create additional pre-aggregations with definitions that fully match your
queries with non-additive measures. You will get a performance boost at the
expense of a slightly increased overall pre-aggregation build time and space
consumed.

Please feel free to check out the

or run it with the `docker-compose up` command. You'll see the result, including
queried data, in the console.
