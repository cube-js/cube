# Refreshing select partitions

## Use case

We have a dataset with orders and we want to aggregate data while having decent
performance. Orders have a creation time, so we can use
[partitioning](https://cube.dev/docs/caching/using-pre-aggregations#partitioning)
by time to optimize pre-aggregations build and refresh time. The problem is that
the order's status can change after a long period. In this case, we want to
rebuild only partitions associated with this order.

In the recipe below, we'll learn how to use the
[`refresh_key`](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/pre-aggregations#parameters-refresh-key-sql)
together with the
[`FITER_PARAMS`](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/cube#filter-params) for
partition separately.

## Data modeling

Let's explore the `orders` cube data that contains various information about
orders, including number and status:

| id  | number | status     | created_at          | updated_at          |
| --- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1   | 1      | processing | 2021-08-10 14:26:40 | 2021-08-10 14:26:40 |
| 2   | 2      | completed  | 2021-08-20 13:21:38 | 2021-08-22 13:10:38 |
| 3   | 3      | shipped    | 2021-09-01 10:27:38 | 2021-09-02 01:12:38 |
| 4   | 4      | completed  | 2021-09-20 10:27:38 | 2021-09-20 10:27:38 |

In our case, each order has `created_at` and `updated_at` properties. The
`updated_at` property is the last order update timestamp. To create a
pre-aggregation with partitions, we need to specify the
[`partition_granularity` property](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/pre-aggregations#partition-granularity).
Partitions will be split monthly by the `created_at` dimension.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders
        type: rollup
        dimensions:
          - number
          - status
          - created_at
          - updated_at
        time_dimension: created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month # this is where we specify the partition
        refreshKey:
          sql: SELECT max(updated_at) FROM public.orders # check for updates of the updated_at property
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  pre_aggregations: {
    orders: {
      type: `rollup`,
      dimensions: [number, status, created_at, updated_at],
      time_dimension: created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`, // this is where we specify the partition
      refresh_key: {
        sql: `SELECT max(updated_at) FROM public.orders`, // check for updates of the updated_at property
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

As you can see, we defined custom a
[`refresh_key`](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/pre-aggregations#parameters-refresh-key-sql)
that will check for new values of the `updated_at` property. The refresh key is
evaluated for each partition separately. For example, if we update orders from
August and update their `updated_at` property, the current refresh key will
update for **all** partitions. There is how it looks in the Cube logs:

```bash
Executing SQL: 5b4c517f-b496-4c69-9503-f8cd2b4c73b6
--
  SELECT max(updated_at) FROM public.orders
--

--
  select min(("orders".created_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) from public.orders AS "orders"
--
Executing SQL: 5b4c517f-b496-4c69-9503-f8cd2b4c73b6
--
  select max(("orders".created_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) from public.orders AS "orders"
--
```

Note that the query for two partitions is the same. It's the reason why **all
partitions** will be updated.

How do we fix this and update only the partition for August? We can use the
[`FILTER_PARAMS`](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/cube#filter-params) for
that!

Let's update our pre-aggregation definition:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders
        type: rollup
        dimensions:
          - number
          - status
          - created_at
          - updated_at
        time_dimension: created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month # this is where we specify the partition
        refreshKey:
          sql: >
            SELECT max(updated_at) FROM public.orders WHERE
            {FILTER_PARAMS.orders.created_at.filter('created_at')}
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  pre_aggregations: {
    orders: {
      type: `rollup`,
      dimensions: [number, status, created_at, updated_at],
      time_dimension: created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`,
      refresh_key: {
        sql: `
          SELECT max(updated_at)
          FROM public.orders
          WHERE ${FILTER_PARAMS.orders.created_at.filter("created_at")}`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

Cube will filter data by the `created_at` property and then apply the refresh
key for the `updated_at` property. Here's how it looks in the Cube logs:

```bash
Executing SQL: e1155b2f-859b-4e61-a760-17af891f5f0b
--
  select min(("updated_orders".created_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) from public.orders AS "updated_orders"
--
Executing SQL: e1155b2f-859b-4e61-a760-17af891f5f0b
--
  select max(("updated_orders".created_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) from public.orders AS "updated_orders"
--

Performing query: e1155b2f-859b-4e61-a760-17af891f5f0b
Executing SQL: e1155b2f-859b-4e61-a760-17af891f5f0b
--
  SELECT max(updated_at) FROM public.orders WHERE created_at >= '2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z'::timestamptz AND created_at <= '2021-08-31T23:59:59.999Z'::timestamptz
--
Executing SQL: e1155b2f-859b-4e61-a760-17af891f5f0b
--
  SELECT max(updated_at) FROM public.orders WHERE created_at >= '2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z'::timestamptz AND created_at <= '2021-09-30T23:59:59.999Z'::timestamptz
```

Note that Cube checks the refresh key value using a date range over the
`created_at` property. With this refresh key, only one partition will be
updated.

## Result

We have received orders from two partitions of a pre-aggregation and only one of
them has been updated when an order changed its status:

```json5
