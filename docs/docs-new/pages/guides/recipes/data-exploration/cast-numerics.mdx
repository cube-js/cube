# Retrieving numeric values on the front-end

## Use case

The REST API returns numeric measure and dimension values as strings.
However, we'd like to receive them as JavaScript `Number` type.
In the recipe below, we explore a way to have numeric values automatically
converted to `Number`. This is a potentially unsafe operation, so we also
explore when it's safe to do so.

## Data modeling

Let's assume we have the following cube with a numeric dimension and a
numeric measure:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: cube_with_big_numbers
    sql: >
      SELECT              123::BIGINT AS number UNION ALL
      SELECT 9007199254740991::BIGINT AS number UNION ALL
      SELECT 9999999999999999::BIGINT AS number

    dimensions:
      - name: number
        sql: number
        type: number

    measures:
      - name: sum
        sql: number
        type: sum
```

## Query via the REST API

Let's send the following query via the REST API:

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    "cube_with_big_numbers.number"
  ],
  "measures": [
    "cube_with_big_numbers.sum"
  ]
}
```

Unsurprisingly, we'll get the following result set in respose:

```json
[
  {
    "cube_with_big_numbers.number": "9999999999999999",
    "cube_with_big_numbers.sum": "9999999999999999"
  },
  {
    "cube_with_big_numbers.number": "9007199254740991",
    "cube_with_big_numbers.sum": "9007199254740991"
  },
  {
    "cube_with_big_numbers.number": "123",
    "cube_with_big_numbers.sum": "123"
  }
]
```

You can see that the REST API returns numeric measure and dimension values
as strings. While it might counter-intuitive, this is actually by design.

[JavaScript numbers][link-js-numbers] are always stored as double precision
floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard.
They can only safely represent integers between `â€“9007199254740991`
and `9007199254740991`, also known as `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` and
[`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`][link-mdn-max-safe-integer]. It's also true with
regards to JSON numbers since they are handled by the JavaScript runtime. 

That is why the REST API returns numeric measure and dimension values as
strings by default. Depending on the nature of your data and domain, you
can decide that numbers are "safe integers" and parse them as instances of
the `Number` type; alternatively, you can parse them as instances of the
`BigInt` type. 

JavaScript SDK provides convenient facilities for the case when all numbers
are considered "safe integers". See how to use them below.

## Query via the JavaScript SDK

Let's use [JavaScript SDK][ref-cubejs-core] to send the same query and print
the result set to the browser console:

```js
import cubejs from "@cubejs-client/core";

const apiUrl = "...";
const apiToken = "...";
const cubeApi = cubejs(apiToken, { apiUrl });

const query = {
  dimensions: ["cube_with_big_numbers.number"],
  measures: ["cube_with_big_numbers.sum"]
};

// 1. Default format
cubeApi.load(query).then((resultSet) => {
  console.log(resultSet.tablePivot());
});

// 2. Format with castNumerics
cubeApi.load(query, { castNumerics: true }).then((resultSet) => {
  console.log(resultSet.tablePivot());
});
```

In the first case, numeric measure and dimension values will be rendered
as strings:

```js
(3) [Object, Object, Object]
  0: Object
    cube_with_big_numbers.number: "9999999999999999"
    cube_with_big_numbers.sum: "9999999999999999"
  1: Object
    cube_with_big_numbers.number: "9007199254740991"
    cube_with_big_numbers.sum: "9007199254740991"
  2: Object
    cube_with_big_numbers.number: "123"
    cube_with_big_numbers.sum: "123"
```

In the second case, when the [`castNumerics`][ref-cubejs-core-cast-numerics]
flag is set to `true`, numeric values are automatically cast to `number`.
As the result, some numbers consequently loose precision:

```js
(3) [Object, Object, Object]
  0: Object
    cube_with_big_numbers.number: 10000000000000000
    cube_with_big_numbers.sum: 10000000000000000
  1: Object
    cube_with_big_numbers.number: 9007199254740991
    cube_with_big_numbers.sum: 9007199254740991
  2: Object
    cube_with_big_numbers.number: 123
    cube_with_big_numbers.sum: 123
```

It is advised to use `castNumerics` only in cases when you're sure that
you work with "safe integers".
