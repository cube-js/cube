# Drilldowns

Drilldowns are a powerful feature to facilitate data exploration. It allows
building an interface to let users dive deeper into visualizations and data
tables. See [`ResultSet.drillDown()`][ref-cubejs-client-ref-resultset-drilldown]
on how to use this feature on the client side.

A drilldown is defined on the [measure][ref-schema-ref-measures] level in your
data model. It’s defined as a list of dimensions called **drill members**. Once
defined, these drill members will always be used to show underlying data when
drilling into that measure.

Let’s consider the following example of our imaginary e-commerce store. We have
the `orders` cube, which describes orders in our store. It’s connected to
`users` and `products`.

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  joins: {
    users: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${users.id}`,
    },

    products: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.product_id = ${products.id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
      // Here we define all possible properties we might want
      // to "drill down" on from our front-end
      drill_members: [id, status, products.name, users.city],
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      type: `number`,
      sql: `id`,
      primary_key: true,
      public: true,
    },

    status: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `status`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    joins:
      - name: users
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE}.user_id = {users.id}"

      - name: products
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE}.product_id = {products.id}"

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        # Here we define all possible properties we might want
        # to "drill down" on from our front-end
        drill_members:
          - id
          - status
          - products.name
          - users.city

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
        public: true

      - name: status
        sql: status
        type: string
```
