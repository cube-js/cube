# Alerts

Cube Cloud lets you set up alerts so you can be notified when there are issues
with any of the deployments in your account.

<SuccessBox>

Alerts are available in Cube Cloud on [Starter](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier.

</SuccessBox>

Alert conditions are checked **once per minute** for configured
[alert types](#alert-types) and [deployments](#deployments). If an alert
condition is triggered, an email notification will be sent to configured
[recipients](#recipients).

Cube Cloud only sends an outage email **once** per configured alert; when the
issue resolves, a resolution email is also sent.

## Alert Types

Cube Cloud has three different types of alerts:

- **API outages.** These are triggered if the deployment's API becomes
  unavailable by monitoring the [`/livez` endpoint][ref-rest-api-livez].
- **Database timeouts.** These are triggered if either the APIs or the database
  are taking longer than expected to respond.
- **Pre-aggregation build failures.** These are triggered if any pre-aggregation
  fails to build.

## How to Configure

<InfoBox>

Only **admin** users can configure alerts in Cube Cloud.

To set up alerts in Cube Cloud, click your username in the top-right for the
menu, then click **Alerts**:

You should now see the Alerts page. The example screenshot below shows no alerts
configured for this deployment:

### Deployments

By default, alerts are configured for all deployments in your account. You can
configure alerts for specific deployments by clicking **Specific** instead of
**All** and then checking the specific deployments you want to monitor:

### Recipients

When creating a new alert, by default, all users will receive email alerts for
any issues. You can also specify particular users who should receive alerts by
toggling the **Specific users** option and selecting them:

Optionally, you can also add additional email addresses that should receive
email notifications by entering the email address in the **Custom email** field:
