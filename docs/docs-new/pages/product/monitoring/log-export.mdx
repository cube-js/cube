# Log Export

Cube Cloud allows exporting logs to third-party services so you can leverage
your existing log management tools.

<SuccessBox>

Log export is available in Cube Cloud on [Enterprise](https://cube.dev/pricing)
tier. [Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact) for details.

</SuccessBox>

Cube Cloud uses [Vector][vector] under the hood, which supports a [wide range of
destinations][vector-docs-sinks].

## Configuration

To enable log export, you need to define a Vector sink configuration file.

In the example below, we'll set up Cube Cloud to forward logs to a hosted Loki
instance on Grafana Cloud.

### Settings

To enable log export, first go to the deployment's settings page and turn it on:

/>

### Secrets

<WarningBox>

Only environment variables prefixed with `CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_` can be used in
`vector.yml`.

</WarningBox>

First, go to your deployment's environment variables, then add the
authentication credentials for the Grafana Cloud-hosted Loki instance. We can
define as many environment variables as we need, but we must prefix them with
`CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_` so that we can use them in our Vector configuration
file later.

/>

### Vector

Now, enter Development Mode and add a file called `vector.toml` to your Cube
project. Open the newly-created file, and then add any relevant sink
configuration. We'll also want to use the environment variables we defined
earlier:

```toml
[sinks.loki]
  type = "loki"
  inputs = [ "cubejs-server", "refresh-scheduler", "ext-db" ]
  endpoint = "https://logs-prod-us-central1.grafana.net"
[sinks.loki.encoding]
  codec = "json"
[sinks.loki.labels]
  app = "cube-cloud"
  env = "production"
[sinks.loki.auth]
  strategy = "basic"
  user = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_USER"
  password = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_PASS"

[sinks.loki_cubestore]
  type = "loki"
  inputs = [ "cubestore" ]
  endpoint = "https://logs-prod-us-central1.grafana.net"
[sinks.loki_cubestore.encoding]
  codec = "json"
[sinks.loki_cubestore.labels]
  app = "cube-store"
  env = "production"
[sinks.loki_cubestore.auth]
  strategy = "basic"
  user = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_USER"
  password = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_PASS"
[sinks.loki_cubestore.cubestore]
  levels = [ "trace", "info", "debug", "error" ]
```

Once done, save the file and commit it to your repository. Once you're back on
the Overview page, you should now see a new "Log Export" resource:

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Overview screen showing Log Export resource"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/468d4cda-0d26-4928-87f0-17df6185d9ce/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

## Notes

### Valid inputs

Valid values for `input` are

- `cubejs-server`
- `refresh-scheduler`
- `ext-db`
- `warmup-job`
- `cubestore`

## Cube Store

The `cubestore` input supports a `levels` property, which allows filtering logs
by type. Valid values are:

- `trace`
- `info`
- `debug`
- `error`

If `levels` is not specified, then only logs of type `info` and `error` will be
sent.
