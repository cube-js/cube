# Monitoring Integrations

Cube Cloud allows exporting logs and metrics to external monitoring tools so you
can leverage your existing monitoring stack and retain logs and metrics for the
long term.

<SuccessBox>

Monitoring integrations are available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier.
[Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact) for details.

</SuccessBox>

<InfoBox>

Monitoring integrations are only available for [dedicated VPC][ref-vpc]
deployments.

</InfoBox>

Under the hood, Cube Cloud uses [Vector][vector], an open-source tool for
collecting and delivering monitoring data. It supports a [wide range of
destinations][vector-docs-sinks], also known as _sinks_.

## Guides

Monitoring integrations work with various popular monitoring tools. Check the
following guides and configuration examples to get tool-specific instructions:

</Grid>

## Configuration

To enable monitoring integrations, navigate to <Btn>Settings → Monitoring
Integrations</Btn> and click <Btn>Enable Vector</Btn> to add a Vector agent to
your deployment.

Under <Btn>Metrics export</Btn>, you will see credentials for the
`prometheus_exporter` sink, in case you'd like to setup [metrics
export][self-sinks-for-metrics].

Additionally, create a [`vector.toml` configration file][vector-docs-config]
next to your `cube.js` file. This file is used to keep sinks configration. You
have to commit this file for Vector configuration to take effect.

### Environment variables

You can use environment variables prefixed with `CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_` to
reference configuration parameters securely in the `vector.toml` file.

Example configuration for exporting logs to
[Datadog][vector-docs-sinks-datadog]:

```toml
[sinks.datadog]
type = "datadog_logs"
default_api_key = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_DATADOG_API_KEY"
```

### Inputs for logs

Sinks accept the `inputs` option that allows to specify which components of a
Cube Cloud deployment should export their logs. Supported inputs:

- `cubejs-server`
- `refresh-scheduler`
- `ext-db`
- `warmup-job`
- `cubestore`

Example configuration for exporting logs to
[Datadog][vector-docs-sinks-datadog]:

```toml
[sinks.datadog]
type = "datadog_logs"
inputs = [
  "cubejs-server",
  "refresh-scheduler",
  "ext-db",
  "warmup-job",
  "cubestore"
]
default_api_key = "da8850ce554b4f03ac50537612e48fb1"
compression = "gzip"
```

When exporting Cube Store logs using the `cubestore` input, you can filter logs
by providing an array of their severity levels via the `levels` option. If not
specified, only `error` and `info` logs will be exported.

| Level   | Exported by default? |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| `error` | ✅ Yes               |
| `info`  | ✅ Yes               |
| `debug` | ❌ No                |
| `trace` | ❌ No                |

### Sinks for logs

You can use a [wide range of destinations][vector-docs-sinks] for logs,
including the following ones:

- [AWS Cloudwatch][vector-docs-sinks-cloudwatch]
- [AWS S3][vector-docs-sinks-s3], [Google Cloud Storage][vector-docs-sinks-gcs],
  and [Azure Blob Storage][vector-docs-sinks-azureblob]
- [Datadog][vector-docs-sinks-datadog]

Example configuration for exporting all logs, including all Cube Store logs to
[Azure Blob Storage][vector-docs-sinks-azureblob]:

```toml
[sinks.azure]
type = "azure_blob"
container_name = "my-logs"
connection_string = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=mylogstorage;AccountKey=storageaccountkeybase64encoded;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
inputs = [
  "cubejs-server",
  "refresh-scheduler",
  "ext-db",
  "warmup-job",
  "cubestore"
]

[sinks.azure.cubestore]
levels = [
  "trace",
  "info",
  "debug",
  "error"
]
```

### Inputs for metrics

Metrics are exported using the `metrics` input. You can filter them by providing
an array of metric names via the `list` option.

| Name                     | Type                                     | Applies to           | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `cpu`                    | [`gauge`][vector-docs-metrics-gauge]     | Node of a deployment | Percent of free CPU against requests           |
| `memory`                 | [`gauge`][vector-docs-metrics-gauge]     | Node of a deployment | Percent of free Memory against requests        |
| `requests-count`         | [`counter`][vector-docs-metrics-counter] | Deployment           | Total number of processed requests             |
| `requests-errors-count`  | [`counter`][vector-docs-metrics-counter] | Deployment           | Number of requests processed with errors       |
| `requests-success-count` | [`counter`][vector-docs-metrics-counter] | Deployment           | Number of requests processed successfully      |
| `requests-duration`      | [`counter`][vector-docs-metrics-counter] | Deployment           | Total time taken to process requests (seconds) |

You can further filter exported metrics by providing an array of `inputs` that
applies to metics only.

Example configuration for exporting all metrics from `cubejs-server` to
[Prometheus][vector-docs-sinks-prometheus] using the `prometheus_remote_write`
sink:

```toml
[sinks.prometheus]
type = "prometheus_remote_write"
inputs = [
  "metrics"
]
endpoint = "https://prometheus.example.com:8087/api/v1/write"

[sinks.prometheus.auth]
# Strategy, credentials, etc.

[sinks.prometheus.metrics]
list = [
  "cpu",
  "memory",
  "requests-count",
  "requests-errors-count",
  "requests-success-count",
  "requests-duration"
]
inputs = [
  "cubejs-server"
]
```

### Sinks for metrics

Metrics are exported in the Prometheus format which is compatible with the
following sinks:

- [`prometheus_exporter`][vector-docs-sinks-prometheus-exporter] (native to
  [Prometheus][prometheus], compatible with [Mimir][mimir])
- [`prometheus_remote_write`][vector-docs-sinks-prometheus] (compatible with
  [Grafana Cloud][grafana-cloud])

Example configuration for exporting all metrics from `cubejs-server` to
[Prometheus][vector-docs-sinks-prometheus-exporter] using the
`prometheus_exporter` sink:

```toml
[sinks.prometheus]
type = "prometheus_exporter"
inputs = [
  "metrics"
]

[sinks.prometheus.metrics]
list = [
  "cpu",
  "memory",
  "requests-count",
  "requests-errors-count",
  "requests-success-count",
  "requests-duration"
]
inputs = [
  "cubejs-server"
]
```

You can customize the user name and password for `prometheus_exporter` by
setting `CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_METRICS_USER` and
`CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_METRICS_PASSWORD` environment variables, respectively.
