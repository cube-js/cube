# Security context

Your authentication server issues JWTs to your client application, which, when
sent as part of the request, are verified and decoded by Cube to get security
context claims to evaluate access control rules. Inbound JWTs are decoded and
verified using industry-standard [JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)][link-auth0-jwks].

For access control or authorization, Cube allows you to define granular access
control rules for every cube in your data model. Cube uses both the request and
security context claims in the JWT token to generate a SQL query, which includes
row-level constraints from the access control rules.

JWTs sent to Cube should be passed in the `Authorization: <JWT>` header to
authenticate requests.

JWTs can also be used to pass additional information about the user, known as a
**security context**. A security context is a verified set of claims about the
current user that the Cube server can use to ensure that users only have access
to the data that they are authorized to access.

It will be accessible as the [`securityContext`][ref-config-sec-ctx] property
inside:

- The [`queryRewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite] configuration option in your
  Cube configuration file.
- the [`COMPILE_CONTEXT`][ref-cubes-compile-ctx] global, which is used to
  support [multi-tenant deployments][link-multitenancy].

## Using query_rewrite

You can use [`query_rewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite] to amend incoming queries
with filters. For example, let's take the following query:

```json
{
  "measures": [
    "orders_view.count"
  ],
  "dimensions": [
    "orders_view.status"
  ]
}
```

We'll also use the following as a JWT payload; `user_id`, `sub` and `iat` will
be injected into the security context:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "user_id": 42
}
```

<WarningBox>

Cube expects the context to be an object. If you don't provide an object as the
JWT payload, you will receive the following error:

```bash
Cannot create proxy with a non-object as target or handler
```

</WarningBox>

To ensure that users making this query only receive their own orders, define
`queryRewrite` in the `cube.js` configuration file:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

@config('query_rewrite')
def query_rewrite(query: dict, ctx: dict) -> dict:
  if 'user_id' in ctx['securityContext']:
    query['filters'].append({
      'member': 'orders_view.users_id',
      'operator': 'equals',
      'values': [ctx['securityContext']['user_id']]
    })
  return query
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    
    if (securityContext.user_id) {
      query.filters.push({
        member: "orders_view.users_id",
        operator: "equals",
        values: [securityContext.user_id],
      });  
    }

    return query;
  },
};
```

</CodeTabs>

To test this, we can generate an API token as follows:

<CodeTabs>
```python
# Install the PyJWT with pip install PyJWT
import jwt
import datetime

# Secret key to sign the token
CUBE_API_SECRET = 'secret'

# Create the token
token_payload = {
  'user_id': 42
}

# Generate the JWT token
token = jwt.encode(token_payload, CUBE_API_SECRET, algorithm='HS256')
```

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const CUBE_API_SECRET = "secret";

const cubejsToken = jwt.sign({ user_id: 42 }, CUBEJS_API_SECRET, {
  expiresIn: "30d",
});
```
</CodeTabs>

Using this token, we authorize our request to the Cube API by passing it in the
Authorization HTTP header.

```bash{outputLines: 2-5}
curl \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1Ijp7ImlkIjo0Mn0sImlhdCI6MTU1NjAyNTM1MiwiZXhwIjoxNTU4NjE3MzUyfQ._8QBL6nip6SkIrFzZzGq2nSF8URhl5BSSSGZYp7IJZ4" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'query={"measures":["orders.count"]}' \
  http://localhost:4000/cubejs-api/v1/load
```

And Cube will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".STATUS "orders_view__status",
  count("orders".ID) "orders_view__count"
FROM
  ECOM.ORDERS AS "orders"
  LEFT JOIN ECOM.USERS AS "users" ON "orders".USER_ID = "users".ID
WHERE
  ("users".ID = 42)
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC
LIMIT
  5000
```

## Using COMPILE_CONTEXT

In the example below `user_id`, `company_id`, `sub` and `iat` will be injected
into the security context and will be accessible in both the [Security
Context][ref-schema-sec-ctx] and [`COMPILE_CONTEXT`][ref-cubes-compile-ctx]
global variable in the Cube data model.

<InfoBox>

`COMPILE_CONTEXT` is used by Cube at data model compilation time, which allows
changing the underlying dataset completely; the Security Context is only used at
query execution time, which simply filters the dataset with a `WHERE` clause.

</InfoBox>

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "user_id": 131,
  "company_id": 500
}
```

With the same JWT payload as before, we can modify models before they are
compiled. The following cube will ensure users only see results for their
`company_id` in a multi-tenant deployment:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: "{COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.company_id}.orders"

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `${COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.company_id}.orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

### Usage with pre-aggregations

To generate pre-aggregations that rely on `COMPILE_CONTEXT`, [configure
`scheduledRefreshContexts` in your `cube.js` configuration
file][ref-config-sched-refresh].

## Testing during development

During development, it is often useful to be able to edit the security context
to test access control rules. The [Developer
Playground][ref-devtools-playground] allows you to set your own JWTs, or you can
build one from a JSON object.
