# Lambda pre-aggregations

Lambda pre-aggregations follow the
[Lambda architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture) design
to union real-time and batch data. Cube acts as a serving layer and uses
pre-aggregations as a batch layer and source data or other pre-aggregations,
usually [streaming][streaming-pre-agg], as a speed layer. Due to this design,
lambda pre-aggregations **only** work with data that is newer than the existing
batched pre-aggregations.

<WarningBox>

Lambda pre-aggregations only work with Cube Store.

## Use cases

Below we are looking at the most common examples of using lambda
pre-aggregations.

### Batch and source data

Batch data is coming from pre-aggregation and real-time data is coming from the
data source.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img

    src="https://ucarecdn.com/a304a8a3-0eb4-4580-a425-052fa353ad69/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

First, you need to create pre-aggregations that will contain your batch data. In
the following example, we call it `batch`. Please note, it must have a
`time_dimension` and `partition_granularity` specified. Cube will use these
properties to union batch data with freshly-retrieved source data.

You may also control the batch part of your data with the `build_range_start` and
`build_range_end` properties of a pre-aggregation to determine a specific window
for your batched data.

Next, you need to create a lambda pre-aggregation. To do that, create
pre-aggregation with type `rollup_lambda`, specify rollups you would like to use
with `rollups` property, and finally set `union_with_source_data: true` to use
source data as a real-time layer.

Please make sure that the lambda pre-aggregation definition comes first when
defining your pre-aggregations.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: lambda
        type: rollup_lambda
        union_with_source_data: true
        rollups:
          - CUBE.batch

      - name: batch
        measures:
          - users.count
        dimensions:
          - users.name
        time_dimension: users.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: day
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT '2020-01-01'
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT '2022-05-30'
```

```javascript
cube('users', {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    lambda: {
      type: `rollup_lambda`,
      union_with_source_data: true,
      rollups: [CUBE.batch]
    },

    batch: {
      measures: [users.count],
      dimensions: [users.name],
      time_dimension: users.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
      build_range_start: {
        sql: `SELECT '2020-01-01'`
      },
      build_range_end: {
        sql: `SELECT '2022-05-30'`
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Batch and streaming data

In this scenario, batch data is comes from one pre-aggregation and real-time
data comes from a [streaming pre-aggregation][streaming-pre-agg].

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    alt="Lambda pre-aggregation batch and streaming diagram"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/88b1be0f-c2ff-4af2-b5f2-50a6a34760c2/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

You can use lambda pre-aggregations to combine data from multiple
pre-aggregations, where one pre-aggregation can have batch data and another
streaming.

        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT '2022-05-30'
```

```javascript

      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.name],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
    },
  },
});

// This cube uses a data source such as ClickHouse or BigQuery
cube('users', {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    batch_streaming_lambda: {
      type: `rollup_lambda`,
      rollups: [users.batch, streaming_users.streaming]
    },

    batch: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measures: [users.count],
      dimensions: [users.name],
      time_dimension: users.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
      build_range_start: {

      },
      build_range_end: {
        sql: `SELECT '2022-05-30'`
      },
    },
  },
});
