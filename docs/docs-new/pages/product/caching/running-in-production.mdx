# Running in production

Cube makes use of two different kinds of cache:

- In-memory storage of query results
- Pre-aggregations

Cube Store is enabled by default when running Cube in development mode. In
production, Cube Store **must** run as a separate process. The easiest way to do
this is to use the official Docker images for Cube and Cube Store.

<InfoBox>

Using Windows? We **strongly** recommend using [WSL2 for Windows 10][link-wsl2]
to run the following commands.

</InfoBox>

You can run Cube Store with Docker with the following command:

```bash{promptUser: user}
docker run -p 3030:3030 cubejs/cubestore
```

<InfoBox>

Cube Store can further be configured via environment variables. To see a
complete reference, please consult the `CUBESTORE_*` environment variables in
the [Environment Variables reference][ref-config-env].

</InfoBox>

Next, run Cube and tell it to connect to Cube Store running on `localhost` (on
the default port `3030`):

```bash{outputLines: 2-4}
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -e CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST=localhost \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  cubejs/cube
```

In the command above, we're specifying `CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST` to let Cube know
where Cube Store is running.

You can also use Docker Compose to achieve the same:

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  cubestore:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data

  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    environment:
      - CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST=localhost
    depends_on:
      - cubestore
    links:
      - cubestore
    volumes:
      - ./model:/cube/conf/model
```

## Architecture

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

</div>

A Cube Store cluster consists of at least one Router and one or more Worker
instances. Cube sends queries to the Cube Store Router, which then distributes
the queries to the Cube Store Workers. The Workers then execute the queries and
return the results to the Router, which in turn returns the results to Cube.

## Scaling

<WarningBox>

Cube Store _can_ be run in a single instance mode, but this is usually
unsuitable for production deployments. For high concurrency and data throughput,
we **strongly** recommend running Cube Store as a cluster of multiple instances
instead.

</WarningBox>

Scaling Cube Store for a higher concurrency is relatively simple when running in
cluster mode. Because [the storage layer](#storage) is decoupled from the query
processing engine, you can horizontally scale your Cube Store cluster for as
much concurrency as you require.

In cluster mode, Cube Store runs two kinds of nodes:

- one or more **router** nodes handle incoming client connections, manage
  database metadata and serve simple queries.
- multiple **worker** nodes which execute SQL queries

Cube Store querying performance is optimal when the count of partitions in a
single query is less than or equal to the worker count. For example, you have a
200 million rows table that is partitioned by day, which is ten daily Cube
partitions or 100 Cube Store partitions in total. The query sent by the user
contains filters, and the resulting scan requires reading 16 Cube Store
partitions in total. Optimal query performance, in this case, can be achieved
with 16 or more workers. You can use `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` SQL
commands to see how many partitions would be used in a specific Cube Store
query.

Resources required for the main node and workers can vary depending on the
configuration. With default settings, you should expect to allocate at least 4
CPUs and up to 8GB per main or worker node.

The configuration required for each node can be found in the table below. More
information about these variables can be found [in the Environment Variables
reference][ref-config-env].

| Environment Variable    | Specify on Router? | Specify on Worker? |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME` | Yes                | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_META_PORT`   | Yes                | -                  |
| `CUBESTORE_WORKERS`     | Yes                | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT` | -                  | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_META_ADDR`   | -                  | Yes                |

`CUBESTORE_WORKERS` and `CUBESTORE_META_ADDR` variables should be set with
stable addresses, which should not change. You can use stable DNS names and put
load balancers in front of your worker and router instances to fulfill stable
name requirements in environments where stable IP addresses can't be guaranteed.

<InfoBox>

To fully take advantage of the worker nodes in the cluster, we **strongly**
recommend using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning].

</InfoBox>

A sample Docker Compose stack for the single machine setting this up might look
like:

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  cubestore_router:
    restart: always
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_META_PORT=9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001,cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
  cubestore_worker_1:
    restart: always
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=9001
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001,cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
  cubestore_worker_2:
    restart: always
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=9001
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001,cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    environment:
      - CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST=cubestore_router
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
    volumes:
      - .:/cube/conf
```

## Replication and High Availability

The open-source version of Cube Store doesn't support replicating any of its
nodes. The router node and every worker node should always have only one
instance copy if served behind the load balancer or service address. Replication
will lead to undefined behavior of the cluster, including connection errors and
data loss. If any cluster node is down, it'll lead to a complete cluster outage.
If Cube Store replication and high availability are required, please consider
using Cube Cloud.

## Storage

<WarningBox>

Cube Store can only use one type of remote storage at runtime.

</WarningBox>

Cube Store makes use of a separate storage layer for storing metadata as well as
for persisting pre-aggregations as Parquet files. Cube Store [can be configured
to use either AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage][ref-config-env]. If desired, local
path on the server can also be used in case all Cube Store cluster nodes are
co-located on a single machine.

<WarningBox>

Cube Store requires strong consistency guarantees from underlying distributed
storage. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage (Cube Cloud only)
are the only known implementations that provide strong consistency. Using other
implementations in production is discouraged and can lead to consistency and
data corruption errors.

</WarningBox>

A simplified example using AWS S3 might look like:

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  cubestore_router:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_META_PORT=9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_S3_BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_S3_REGION=<BUCKET_REGION_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
  cubestore_worker_1:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=9001
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_S3_BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_S3_REGION=<BUCKET_REGION_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
```

### Local Storage

Separately from remote storage, Cube Store requires local scratch space to warm
up partitions by downloading Parquet files before querying them. By default,
this directory should be mounted to `.cubestore/data` dir inside contained and
can be configured by [CUBESTORE_DATA_DIR][ref-config-env] environment variable.
It is advised to use local SSDs for this scratch space to maximize querying
performance.

###  AWS

Cube Store can retrieve security credentials from instance metadata
automatically. This means you can skip defining the
`CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment
variables.

<WarningBox>

Cube Store currently does not take the key expiration time returned from
instance metadata into account; instead the refresh duration for the key is
defined by `CUBESTORE_AWS_CREDS_REFRESH_EVERY_MINS`, which is set to `180` by
default.

</WarningBox>

## Security

Cube Store currently does not have any in-built authentication mechanisms. For
this reason, we recommend running your Cube Store cluster on a network that only
allows requests from the Cube deployment.
