# Connecting with a VPC on GCP

## Prerequisites

- [Google Cloud Project ID][gcp-docs-projects]
- Google Cloud VPC Network Name

## Setup

### VPC Peering

After receiving the information above, create a [VPC peering
request][gcp-docs-vpc-peering], either through the [GCP Web
Console][gcp-console] or an infrastructure-as-code tool. To send a VPC peering
request through the Google Cloud Console, follow [the instructions
here][gcp-docs-create-vpc-peering], with the following amendments:

- In Step 6, use the project name `XXXXX` and network name(s) provided by Cube
  Cloud.
- In Step 7, ensure **Import custom routes** and **Export custom routes** are
  selected so that the necessary routes are created.

## Supported Regions

- `northeast1`
- `europe-west-2`
- `europe-west-3`
- `us-central-1`

## Notes

### Cloud SQL

Google Cloud SQL databases [can only be peered to a VPC within the same GCP
project][gcp-docs-vpc-peering-restrictions]. To work around this limitation, we
recommend that customers provision a micro VM in their Google Cloud account to
run the [Cloud SQL Auth Proxy][gcp-cloudsql-auth-proxy].
