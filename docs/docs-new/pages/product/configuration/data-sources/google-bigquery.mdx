# Google BigQuery

## Prerequisites

<InfoBox>

In order to connect Google BigQuery to Cube, you need to provide service account
credentials. Cube requires the service account to have **BigQuery Data Viewer**
and **BigQuery Job User** roles enabled. You can learn more about acquiring
Google BigQuery credentials [here][bq-docs-getting-started].

</InfoBox>

- The [Google Cloud Project ID][google-cloud-docs-projects] for the
  [BigQuery][bq] project
- A set of [Google Cloud service credentials][google-support-create-svc-account]
  which [allow access][bq-docs-getting-started] to the [BigQuery][bq] project
- The [Google Cloud region][bq-docs-regional-locations] for the [BigQuery][bq]
  project

## Setup

### Manual

Add the following to a `.env` file in your Cube project:

```dotenv
CUBEJS_DB_TYPE=bigquery
CUBEJS_DB_BQ_PROJECT_ID=my-bigquery-project-12345
CUBEJS_DB_BQ_KEY_FILE=/path/to/my/keyfile.json
```

You could also encode the key file using Base64 and set the result to
`CUBEJS_DB_BQ_CREDENTIALS`:

```dotenv
CUBEJS_DB_BQ_CREDENTIALS=$(cat /path/to/my/keyfile.json | base64)
```

### Cube Cloud

<InfoBox heading="Allowing connections from Cube Cloud IP">

In some cases you'll need to allow connections from your Cube Cloud deployment
IP address to your database. You can copy the IP address from either the
Database Setup step in deployment creation, or from <Btn>Settings →
Configuration</Btn> in your deployment.

</InfoBox>

The following fields are required when creating a BigQuery connection:

/>

Cube Cloud also supports connecting to data sources within private VPCs. If you
already have VPCs enabled in your account, check out the [VPC
documentation][ref-cloud-conf-vpc] to learn how to get started.

<SuccessBox>

VPC connectivity is available in Cube Cloud on
[Premium](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier. [Contact us][cube-contact] for
details.

## Pre-Aggregation Feature Support

### count_distinct_approx

Measures of type
[`count_distinct_approx`][ref-schema-ref-types-formats-countdistinctapprox] can
be used in pre-aggregations when using Google BigQuery as a source database. To
learn more about Google BigQuery's support for approximate aggregate functions,
[click here][bq-docs-approx-agg-fns].

## Pre-Aggregation Build Strategies

<InfoBox>

To learn more about pre-aggregation build strategies, [head
here][ref-caching-using-preaggs-build-strats].

</InfoBox>

| Feature       | Works with read-only mode? | Is default? |
| ------------- | :------------------------: | :---------: |
| Batching      |             ❌             |     ✅      |
| Export Bucket |             ❌             |     ❌      |

By default, Google BigQuery uses [batching][self-preaggs-batching] to build
pre-aggregations.

### Batching

No extra configuration is required to configure batching for Google BigQuery.

### Export bucket

<WarningBox>

BigQuery only supports using Google Cloud Storage for export buckets.

</WarningBox>

#### Google Cloud Storage

For [improved pre-aggregation performance with large
datasets][ref-caching-large-preaggs], enable export bucket functionality by
configuring Cube with the following environment variables:

<InfoBox>

When using an export bucket, remember to assign the **BigQuery Data Editor** and
**Storage Object Admin** role to your BigQuery service account.

</InfoBox>

```dotenv
CUBEJS_DB_EXPORT_BUCKET=export_data_58148478376
CUBEJS_DB_EXPORT_BUCKET_TYPE=gcp
```

## SSL

Cube does not require any additional configuration to enable SSL as Google
BigQuery connections are made over HTTPS.
