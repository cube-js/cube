# Overview

Cube can be configured in two ways. The first is through [options][link-config]
in a configuration file, commonly known as the `cube.js` file, and secondly,
through [environment variables][link-env-vars]. Values specified in `cube.js`
will take precedence over environment variables.

<InfoBox>

When using Docker, ensure that the `cube.js` configuration file and your
`model/` [folder][ref-folder-structure] are mounted to `/cube/conf` within the
Docker container.

</InfoBox>

## Cube Cloud

You can set environment variables in&nbsp;<Btn>Settings → Configuration</Btn>:

## Development Mode

Cube can be run in an insecure, development mode by setting the
`CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` environment variable to `true`. Putting Cube in development
mode does the following:

- Disables authentication checks
- Enables Cube Store in single instance mode
- Enables background refresh for in-memory cache and [scheduled
  pre-aggregations][link-scheduled-refresh]
- Allows another log level to be set (`trace`)
- Enables [Developer Playground][link-dev-playground] on `http://localhost:4000`
- Uses `memory` instead of `cubestore` as the default cache/queue engine
- Logs incorrect/invalid configuration for `externalRefresh` /`waitForRenew`
  instead of throwing errors

## Concurrency and pooling

<InfoBox>

All Cube database drivers come with presets for concurrency and pooling that
work out-of-the-box. The following information is included as a reference.

</InfoBox>

For increased performance, Cube uses multiple concurrent connections to
configured data sources. The `CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY` environment variable controls
concurrency settings for query queues and the refresh scheduler as well as the
maximum concurrent connections. For databases that support connection pooling,
the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database can also be set by
using the `CUBEJS_DB_MAX_POOL` environment variable; if changing this from the
default, you must ensure that the new value is greater than the number of
concurrent connections used by Cube's query queues and refresh scheduler.
