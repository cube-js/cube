# Retool

[Retool](https://retool.com/) is the fast way to build internal tools. It lets
you visually design apps that interface with any database or API. You can
connect a Cube deployment to Retool using Cube’s
[REST API](https://cube.dev/docs/rest-api).

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Retool to Cube.

## Use REST API in Cube

###  Cube Cloud

Click the "How to connect" link on the Overview page, navigate to the REST API
tab. You will see your connection credentials, the REST API URL and the
authorization token:

###  Self-hosted Cube

For a Cube instance publicly available at a specific `HOST`, the REST API URL
would be `HOST/cubejs-api/v1`. Please refer to the
[REST API page](https://cube.dev/docs/rest-api) for details.

You will also need to generate a JSON Web Token that would be used to
authenticate requests to Cube.

Please check the
[Security page](https://cube.dev/docs/security#generating-json-web-tokens-jwt)
to learn how to generate a token. We suggest generating a long-lived JWT that
won't expire soon.

## Create a new resource in Retool

Create a new "REST API" resource in Retool.

Next, copy and paste Cube's REST API URL and the Authorization token.

## Create a POST request in Retool

Get your Cube query in the JSON
[query format](https://cube.dev/docs/query-format) ready. You can copy it from
Cube’s Playground or compose manually.

Create a POST request, paste the JSON query in the **Body**. Make sure to add a
`query` parameter for your JSON query.

Because the Cube REST API has the format of `HOST/cubejs-api/v1`, don't forget
to add the `/load` endpoint to the end of the data source API.

Next, hit Run.

## Display the data in Retool

Retool has an amazing feature where you can drag and drop UI components into the
dashboard. You can use this to add a tables, bar charts, and much more.

Because the name of the Retool query in the example is `OrdersByMonth`, using
the data binding curly brackets will populate the charts with data from the REST
API.

```
{{ OrdersByMonth.data.data }}
```

Reference the name of the query in your Retool charts.
