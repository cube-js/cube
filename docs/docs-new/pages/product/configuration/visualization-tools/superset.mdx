# Superset

You can connect a Cube project to [Apache Superset][superset] using the Cube SQL
API. [Apache Superset][superset] is an open-source data exploration and
visualization platform, commonly used to visualize business metrics and
performance.

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Apache Superset to Cube.

## Enable Cube SQL API

<InfoBox>

</InfoBox>

### Cube Cloud

Click **How to connect your BI tool** link on the Overview page, navigate to the
SQL API tab and enable it. Once enabled, you should see the screen like the one
below with your connection credentials:

### Self-hosted Cube

You need to set the following environment variables to enable the Cube SQL API.
These credentials will be required to connect to Cube from Superset later.

```dotenv
CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432
CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

### Connecting from Superset

Apache Superset connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

In Apache Superset, go to **Data > Databases**, then click **+ Database** to add
a new database:

## Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

Let's use the following Cube data model:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: status
        sql: status
        type: string

      - name: created
        sql: created_at
        type: time
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    created_at: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

</CodeTabs>

Using the SQL API, `orders` will be exposed as a table. In Superset, we can
create datasets based on tables. Let's create one from `orders` table:

<Screenshot
  alt="Apache Superset: SQL Editor page with successful query"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/eebd3839-03db-4492-a7e4-a7cc1d9ffc73/"
/>

Now, we can explore this dataset. Let's create a new chart of type line with
"Orders" dataset.

<Screenshot
  alt="Apache Superset: SQL Editor page with successful query"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/c509c6fb-f633-4ded-ae94-d4768978c47a/"
/>

We can select the `COUNT(*)` as a metric and `created_at` as the time column
with a time grain of `month`.

The `COUNT(*)` aggregate function is being mapped to a measure of type
[count](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#measures-types-count)
in Cube's **Orders** data model file.

## Additional Configuration

### Pre-Aggregations

To allow queries from Superset to match pre-aggregations in Cube, [the
`allow_non_strict_date_range_match`
property][ref-schema-ref-preagg-allownonstrict] must be set to `true` in the
pre-aggregation definition. This is because Superset uses loose date ranges when
generating SQL queries.
