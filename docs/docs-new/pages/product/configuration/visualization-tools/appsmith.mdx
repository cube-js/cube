# Appsmith

[Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com) is an open-source framework for building
internal tools. You can connect a Cube deployment to Appsmith using Cube’s
[REST API](https://cube.dev/docs/rest-api).

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Appsmith to Cube.

## Use REST API in Cube

###  Cube Cloud

Click the “How to connect” link on the Overview page, navigate to the REST API
tab. You should see the screen below with your connection credentials (the REST
API URL and the authorization token):

###  Self-hosted Cube

For a Cube instance publicly available at a specific `HOST`, the REST API URL
would be `HOST/cubejs-api/v1`. Please refer to the
[REST API page](https://cube.dev/docs/rest-api) for details.

You will also need to generate a JSON Web Token that would be used to
authenticate requests to Cube.

Please check the
[Security page](https://cube.dev/docs/security#generating-json-web-tokens-jwt)
to learn how to generate a token. We suggest generating a long-lived JWT that
won't expire soon.

## Create a new Data Source in Appsmith

Copy and paste the REST API URL and the Authorization token to create a new data
source in Appsmith.

## Create a POST request in Appsmith

Get your Cube query in the JSON
[query format](https://cube.dev/docs/query-format) ready. You can copy it from
Cube’s Playground or compose manually:

Create a POST request, paste the JSON query in the **Body**. Make sure to add a
`query` parameter for your JSON query.

Because you saved the data source as `HOST/cubejs-api/v1`, don't forget to add a
`/load` endpoint to the end of the data source API.

Next, hit Run.

## Display the Data in Appsmith

You have many options to display the data in Appsmith. For instance, you can
display the data in a table widget. Also, you can create a chart widget and map
the values to _x_ and _y_ coordinates accordingly, give a _title_ and _names_ to
the _axis_.
