# Jupyter

You can connect to Cube from Jupyter using the [Cube SQL API][ref-sql-api]. The
Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating and sharing computational
documents.

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Jupyter to Cube.

## Enable Cube SQL API

<InfoBox>

Don't have a Cube project yet? [Learn how to get started
here][ref-getting-started].

</InfoBox>

### Cube Cloud

Click **Deploy SQL API** and then the **How to connect your BI tool** link on
the Overview page of your Cube deployment. Navigate to the **BIs and
Visualization Tools** tab. You should see the screen like the one below with
your connection credentials:

### Self-hosted Cube

You need to set the following environment variables to enable the Cube SQL API.
These credentials will be required to connect to Cube from Jupyter later.

```dotenv
CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432
CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

## Connecting from Jupyter

Jupyter connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

Make sure to install the `sqlalchemy` and `pandas` modules.

```bash{promptUser: user}
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pandas
```

Then you can use `sqlalchemy.create_engine` to connect to Cube's SQL API.

```python
import sqlalchemy
import pandas

engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(
    sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL(
        drivername="postgresql",
        username="cube",
        password="9943f670fd019692f58d66b64e375213",
        host="thirsty-raccoon.sql.aws-eu-central-1.cubecloudapp.dev",
        port="5432",
        database="db@thirsty-raccoon",
    ),
    echo_pool=True,
)
print("connecting with engine " + str(engine))
connection = engine.connect()

# ...
```

## Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

You can write SQL in Jupyter that will be executed in Cube. Learn more about
Cube SQL syntax on the [reference page][ref-sql-api].

```python
# ...

query = "SELECT SUM(count), status FROM orders GROUP BY status;"
df = pandas.read_sql_query(query, connection)
```

In your Jupyter notebook it'll look like this.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/616046d9-729f-426e-8000-d15c6ca90347/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

You can also create a visualization of the executed SQL query.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/91f558c2-f65c-43cf-9747-3423c3894330/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>
