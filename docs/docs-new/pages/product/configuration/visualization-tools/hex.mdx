# Hex

You can connect to Cube from Hex, a collaborative data platform, using the [Cube
SQL API][ref-sql-api].

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Hex to Cube.

###  Self-hosted Cube

You need to set the following environment variables to enable the Cube SQL API.
These credentials will be required to connect to Cube from Hex later.

```dotenv
CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432
CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

## Connecting from Hex

Hex connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

## Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

You can write SQL in Hex that will be executed in Cube. Learn more about Cube
SQL syntax on the [reference page][ref-sql-api].
