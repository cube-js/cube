# Langchain

[LangChain][langchain] is a framework designed to simplify the creation of
applications using large language models.

To get started with Langchain, follow the [instructions
here][langchain-docs-getting-started].

## Configuring the connection to Cube

LangChain connects to Cube using the [REST API][ref-rest-api], and will need a
[JWT][ref-jwt] to authenticate.

If you're using Cube Cloud, you can retrieve these details from a deployment's
<Btn>Overview</Btn> page.

## Querying Cube

Please refer to the [Cube loader documentation on
LangChain][langchain-docs-cube] for more information on how to query Cube.
