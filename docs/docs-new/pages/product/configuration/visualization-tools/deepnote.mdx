# Deepnote

You can connect to Cube from Deepnote, a new kind of data notebook that's built
for collaboration and is Jupyter compatible, using the [Cube SQL
API][ref-sql-api].

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Deepnote to Cube.

## Enable Cube SQL API

<InfoBox>

Don't have a Cube project yet? [Learn how to get started
here][ref-getting-started].

</InfoBox>

###  Cube Cloud

Click **Deploy SQL API** and then the **How to connect your BI tool** link on
the Overview page of your Cube deployment. Navigate to the **BIs and
Visualization Tools** tab. You should see the screen like the one below with
your connection credentials:

###  Self-hosted Cube

You need to set the following environment variables to enable the Cube SQL API.
These credentials will be required to connect to Cube from Deepnote later.

```dotenv
CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432
CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

## Connecting from Deepnote

Deepnote connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

## Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

You can write SQL in Deepnote that will be executed in Cube. Learn more about
Cube SQL syntax on the [reference page][ref-sql-api].
