###  Self-hosted Cube

You need to set the following environment variables to enable the Cube SQL API.
These credentials will be required to connect to Cube from PowerBI later.

```dotenv

CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

## Connecting from Power BI

Power BI connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

## Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.
