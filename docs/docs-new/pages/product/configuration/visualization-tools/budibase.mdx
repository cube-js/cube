# Budibase

Budibase is a low-code app-building platform that helps developers create
responsive web applications with access methods to databases, APIs, and much
more. You can connect a Cube deployment to Budibase using Cube's
[REST API](https://cube.dev/docs/rest-api).

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Budibase to Cube.

## Use REST API in Cube

> Don't have a Cube project yet?
> [Learn how to get started here](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started/cloud/overview).

### Cube Cloud

Click the "How to connect" link on the Overview page, navigate to the REST API
tab. You will see your connection credentials, the REST API URL and the
authorization token:

### Self-hosted Cube

For a Cube instance publicly available at a specific `HOST`, the REST API URL
would be `HOST/cubejs-api/v1`. Please refer to the
[REST API page](https://cube.dev/docs/rest-api) for details.

You will also need to generate a JSON Web Token that would be used to
authenticate requests to Cube.

Please check the
[Security page](https://cube.dev/docs/security#generating-json-web-tokens-jwt)
to learn how to generate a token. We suggest generating a long-lived JWT that
won't expire soon.

## Create a new data source in Budibase

Create a new "REST API" data source in Budibase.

Next, add a "Authorization" header for the REST API. Copy and paste Cube's
Authorization token.

## Add a query in Budibase

Click "+ Add Query".

Copy and paste the Cube REST API, including the `/load` path, in the API field.
Make sure to select "POST" as the request.

Get your Cube query in the JSON
[query format](https://cube.dev/docs/query-format) ready. You can copy it from
Cube's Playground or compose manually.

Paste the JSON query in the **Body** as "raw(JSON)". Make sure to add a `query`
parameter for your JSON query.

Edit the **Transform** to return the data of the request.

    return data.data

You can also give the query a name. In this sample it's called `OrdersByMonth`.

Lastly, click the "save" button and hit "send" to test the API and get a
response back.

## Create a data provider in Budibase

Move to the **Design** section and open the **Components**.

First, add a Data Provider. Select the query from above. In this sample it's
called `OrdersByMonth`.

## Display the data in Budibase

Add a chart into the data provider. Next, configure the data provider for the
chart. Make sure it's set to the data provider you just created.

Then, you set the "label column" and "data columns". In this sample you can set
`Orders.createdAt` as the label column and `Orders.count` as the data columns.

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/2f0ef897-13eb-4dc2-8869-e847618df4d9/" />

You'll see a nicely rendered chart show up.
