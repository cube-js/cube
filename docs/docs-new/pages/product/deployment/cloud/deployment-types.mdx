# Deployment types

## Development Instance

<SuccessBox>

Development instance is available in Cube Cloud for free, no credit card
required. Your free trial is limited to 2 development instances and only 1,000
queries per day. Upgrade to [any tier](https://cube.dev/pricing) to unlock all
features.

</SuccessBox>

</div>

Development Instances are designed for development use-cases only. This makes it
easy to get started with Cube Cloud quickly, and also allows you to build and
query pre-aggregations on-demand.

Development Instances do not provide high-availability nor do they guarantee
fast response times. Development Instances also hibernate after 60 minutes of
inactivity, which can cause the first request after hibernation to take
additional time to process. They also have a 10,000 queries per day limit, and
are limited to a maximum of 2 Cube Store Workers. We **strongly** advise not
using a development instance in a production environment, it is for testing and
learning about Cube only and will not deliver a production-level experience for
your users.

You can try a Cube Cloud development instance by
[signing up for Cube Cloud](https://cubecloud.dev/auth/signup) to try it free
(no credit card required).

## Production Cluster

<SuccessBox>

Production cluster is available in Cube Cloud on
[all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

</div>

Production Clusters are designed to support high-availability production
workloads. It consists of several key components, including starting with 2 Cube
API instances, 1 Cube Refresh Worker and 2 Cube Store Routers - all of which run
on dedicated infrastructure. The cluster can automatically scale to meet the
needs of your workload by adding more components as necessary; check the
[Limits section](#limits) below.

## Production multi-cluster

You can deploy a production multi-cluster in Cube Cloud, which allows for larger
amounts of data as well as load balancing for multi-tenant deployments with over
1,000 tenants.

<SuccessBox>

Production multi-cluster is available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier.
[Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact) for details.

</SuccessBox>

</div>

Cube Cloud routes traffic between clusters based on
[`contextToAppId()`][ref-conf-ref-ctx-to-app-id].

Each cluster is billed separately, and all clusters can use auto-scaling to
match demand.

## Limits

Cube Cloud also allows adding additional infrastructure to your deployment to
increase scalability and performance beyond what is available with each
Production Deployment.

### Cube Store Worker

|                           | Free Tier | Starter | Premium | Enterprise |        Enterprise Premier        |
| ------------------------- | :-------: | :-----: | :-----: | :--------: | :------------------------------: |
| Maximum number of workers |     2     |   16    |   16    |     16     | [Talk to Sales][cube-contact-us] |

Cube Store Workers are used to build and persist pre-aggregations. Each Worker
has a **maximum of 150GB** of storage; additional Cube Store workers can be
added to your deployment to both increase storage space and improve
pre-aggregation performance. A **minimum of 2** Cube Store Workers is required
for pre-aggregations; this can be adjusted. For a rough estimate, it will take
approximately 2 Cube Store Workers per 4 gigs of pre-aggregated data per day.

<InfoBox>

Idle workers will automatically hibernate after 10 minutes of inactivity, and
will not consume CCUs until they are resumed. Workers are resumed automatically
when Cube receives a query that should be accelerated by a pre-aggregation, or
when a scheduled refresh is triggered.

</InfoBox>

To change the number of Cube Store Workers in a deployment, go to the
deployment’s <Btn>Settings</Btn> screen, and open the <Btn>Configuration</Btn>
tab. From this screen, you can set the number of Cube Store Workers from the
dropdown:

### Cube API Instance

|                 | Free Tier | Starter |  Premium  | Enterprise | Enterprise Premier |
| --------------- | :-------: | :-----: | :-------: | :--------: | :----------------: |
| Queries per day |   1,000   | 50,000  | Unlimited | Unlimited  |     Unlimited      |

With a Production Deployment, 2 Cube API Instances are included. That said, it
is very common to use more, and additional Cube API instances can be added to
your deployment to increase the throughput of your queries. A rough estimate is
that 1 Cube API Instance is needed for every 5-10 requests-per-second served.
Cube API Instances can also auto-scale as needed.

To change how many Cube API instances are available in the Production Cluster,
go to the deployment’s <Btn>Settings</Btn> screen, and open
the <Btn>Configuration</Btn> tab. From this screen, you can set the minimum and
maximum number of Cube API instances for a deployment:

/>

## Switching between deployment types

To switch a deployment's type, go to the deployment's <Btn>Settings</Btn> screen
and select from the available options:
