# Custom domains

By default, Cube Cloud deployments and their API endpoints use auto-generated
anonymized domain names, e.g., `emerald-llama.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev`.
You can also assign a custom domain to your deployment.

<SuccessBox>

Custom domains are available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier.
[Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact) for details.

To set up a custom domain, go to your deployment's settings page. Under
the <Btn>Custom Domain</Btn> section, type in your custom domain and
click <Btn>Add</Btn>:

After doing this, copy the provided domain and add the following `CNAME` records
to your DNS provider:

| Name          | Value                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `YOUR_DOMAIN` | The copied value from Cube Cloud's settings |

Using the example subdomain from the screenshot, a `CNAME` record for `acme.dev`
would look like:

| Name       | Value                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `insights` | `colossal-crowville.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev` |

DNS changes can sometimes take up to 15 minutes to propagate, please wait at
least 15 minutes and/or try using another DNS provider to verify the `CNAME`
record correctly before raising a new support ticket.
