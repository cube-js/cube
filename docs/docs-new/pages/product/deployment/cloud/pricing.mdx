# Pricing

Cube Cloud pricing is based on consumption of compute power which we measure
using Cube Compute Units in 5 minute intervals. The units are priced based on
which subscription plan you have chosen. Each plan has different features and
functionality that you should review as you think about what is right for your
business.

<InfoBox heading="What's a Cube Compute Unit?">

A **Cube Compute Unit** is a way to measure compute power used to run Cube Cloud
infrastructure. The price of a compute unit is determined by the Cube Cloud plan
you're subscribed to.

</InfoBox>

| Node Type                 | Compute Unit per hour (measured in 5 minute intervals) |
| ------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| Cube Production Cluster   |                          `4`                           |
| Cube Development Instance |                          `1`                           |
| Cube Store Worker         |                          `1`                           |
| Cube API Instance         |                          `1`                           |

Cube Cloud has four subscription plans that you can review
[here](https://cube.dev/pricing). The subscription plan you choose will
determine the price per Cube Compute Unit (CCU). Each subscription plan
determines the features, scalability, availability, as well as the speed and
scope of support you may receive for your deployment. During your deployment,
Premium, Enterprise, and Enterprise Premier customers can set
[Budgets][ref-cloud-budgets] to make sure you know your usage is on track and as
expected.

Official support hours are weekdays (Monday through Friday) from 8am ET to 8pm

## Support Priority Definitions

We prioritize support requests based on their severity, as follows:

- **P0**: The platform is severely impacted or completely shut down. We will
  assign specialists to work continuously to fix the issue, provide ongoing
  updates, and start working on a temporary workaround or fix.

- **P1**: The platform is functioning with limited capabilities or facing
  critical issues preventing a production deployment. We will assign specialists
  to fix the issue, provide ongoing updates, and start working on a temporary
  workaround or fix.

- **P2**: There are issues with workaround solutions or non-critical functions.
  We will use resources during local business hours until the issue is resolved
  or a workaround is in place.

- **P3**: There is a need for clarification in the documentation, or a
  suggestion for product enhancement. We will triage the request, provide
  clarification when possible, and may include a resolution in a future update.

## Overages and Payment Terms

### Overages

If your usage of resources exceeds the balance of CCUs in your account, the CCU
price will revert from the Annual Commit Price (available on the pricing page
here) to the Standard Retail Price shown below:

| Subscription Plan  | CCU Price (Standard Retail Price) |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Premium            | 0.45                              |
| Enterprise         | 0.60                              |
| Enterprise Premier | 0.90                              |

### Upgrades

You may upgrade your CCUs to a higher-level subscription plan at any time by
paying the difference in per-Cube Compute Unit pricing, or by asking to convert
the price paid for the remaining CCUs into CCUs for the higher subscription plan
at the CCU pricing for that plan (resulting in a lower number of available CCUs
but upgraded to the higher subscription plan).

### Terms

If payment is not received within the contract terms (usually Net-30) or for
additional required payment for CCUs exceeding the balance of CCUs in your
account, services may degrade or be suspended until new CCUs are purchased.

Future purchases and upgrades are subject to the pricing that is in effect at
the time of the order. No credit is allowed for downgrading CCUs to a lower
subscription plan level. Payments are non-refundable.
