# Pricing

Cube Cloud pricing is based on consumption of compute power which we measure
using Cube Compute Units. The units are priced based on which subscription plan
you have chosen. Each plan has different features and functionality that you
should review as you think about what is right for your business.

<InfoBox heading="What's a Cube Compute Unit?">

A **Cube Compute Unit** is a way to measure compute power used to run Cube Cloud
infrastructure. The price of a compute unit is determined by the Cube Cloud plan
you're subscribed to.

</InfoBox>

| Node Type                 | Compute Unit per hour |
| ------------------------- | :-------------------: |
| Cube Production Cluster   |          `4`          |
| Cube Development Instance |          `1`          |
| Cube Store Worker         |          `1`          |
| Cube API Instance         |          `1`          |

Cube Cloud has four subscription plans that you can review
[here](https://cube.dev/pricing). The subscription plan you choose will
determine the price per Cube Compute Unit (CCU). Each subscription plan
determines the features, scalability, availability, as well as the speed and
scope of support you may receive for your deployment.

## Support Priority Definitions

We prioritize support requests based on their severity, as follows:

- **P0**: The platform is severely impacted or completely shut down. We will
  assign specialists to work continuously to fix the issue, provide ongoing
  updates, and start working on a temporary workaround or fix.

- **P1**: The platform is functioning with limited capabilities or facing
  critical issues preventing a production deployment. We will assign specialists
  to fix the issue, provide ongoing updates, and start working on a temporary
  workaround or fix.

- **P2**: There are issues with workaround solutions or non-critical functions.
  We will use resources during local business hours until the issue is resolved
  or a workaround is in place.

- **P3**: There is a need for clarification in the documentation, or a
  suggestion for product enhancement. We will triage the request, provide
  clarification when possible, and may include a resolution in a future update.

## Payment Terms

Future purchases and upgrades are subject to the pricing that is in effect at
the time of the order. Payments are non-refundable. If your usage of resources
exceeds the balance of CCUs in your account, services may degrade or be
suspended until new CCUs are purchased. You may upgrade your CCUs to a
higher-level subscription plan at any time by paying the difference in per-Cube
Compute Unit pricing, or by asking to convert the price paid for the remaining
CCUs into CCUs for the higher subscription plan at the CCU pricing for that plan
(resulting in a lower number of available CCUs but upgraded to the higher
subscription plan). Future purchases and upgrades are subject to the pricing
that is in effect at the time of the order. No credit is allowed for downgrading
CCUs to a lower subscription plan level.
