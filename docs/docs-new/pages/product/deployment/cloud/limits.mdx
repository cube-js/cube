# Limits

Cube Cloud implements limits on resource usage on account and deployment levels
to ensure the best experience for all Cube Cloud users.

<SuccessBox>

Limits apply to Cube Cloud accounts on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

## Limit types

Each limit can be of one of the following types:

- _Hard limit_ either has a threshold that can't be exceeded or prevents further
  use of a resource when a threshhold is hit until a cool-down period passes
  (e.g., until the next day starts) or the limit is increased (e.g., when a Cube
  Cloud account upgrades to another tier).
- _Soft limit_ may allow further use of a resource after a threshold is hit.

## Resources

The following resources are subject to limits, depending on [deployment
types][ref-deployment-types] and [pricing tiers][ref-pricing]:

| Resource                                                        | Free Tier |  Starter  |  Premium  | Enterprise |      Enterprise Premier       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: |
| Number of deployments                                           |     2     | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited  |           Unlimited           |
| Number of API instances                                         |     1     |    20     |    20     |     20     | [Contact us][cube-contact-us] |

| Queries per day ([development instance][ref-dev-instance])      |   1,000   |  10,000   | Unlimited | Unlimited  |           Unlimited           |
| Queries per day ([production cluster][ref-prod-cluster])        |     â€”     |  50,000   | Unlimited | Unlimited  |           Unlimited           |
| Queries processed by [Query History][ref-query-history] per day |   1,000   |  50,000   |  100,000  |  200,000   |            300,000            |

### Number of deployments

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Number of API instances

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Number of Cube Store workers

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Queries per day

This is a hard limit. Usage is calculated per Cube Cloud account, i.e., in total
for all deployments within an account.

When a threshold is hit, further queries will not be processed. In that case,
consider upgrading a development instance to a production cluster.
Alternatively, consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Queries processed by Query History per day

This is a soft limit. Usage is calculated per Cube Cloud account, i.e., in total
for all deployments within an account.

When a threshold is hit, query processing will be stopped. Please [contact
support][cube-contact-us] for further assistance.
