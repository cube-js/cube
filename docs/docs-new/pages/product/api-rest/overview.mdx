# Overview
<SuccessBox>

**We’re running a survey to better understand how you use Cube.** Please take a moment to [share with us what you think](https://forms.gle/b7iQHpocAXfpNfeR7). It will mean the world to us.

</SuccessBox>

## Prerequisites

###  Base path

REST API is used to communicate with Cube backend. All requests are prefixed
with **basePath** described in
[Backend Server Core](@cubejs-backend-server-core). By default, it is set to
`/cubejs-api`.

###  Authentication

Cube uses API tokens to authorize requests and also for passing additional
security context, which can be used in the
[`queryRewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite] property in your [`cube.js`
configuration file][ref-config-js].

The API Token is passed via the Authorization Header. The token itself is a
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io), the [Security section][ref-security] describes
how to generate it.

In the development environment the token is not required for authorization, but
you can still use it to pass a security context.

###  Example request

```bash{promptUser: user}
curl -H "Authorization: EXAMPLE-API-TOKEN" https://example.com/cubejs-api/v1/sql
```

###  Configuring CORS

REST API supports [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)][mdn-cors].

By default, requests from any origin (`*`) are allowed. To allow requests from a
specific domain only, use the following configuration in the `cube.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  http: {
    cors: {
      origin: "https://example.com",
    },
  },
};
```

Please see [configuration options][ref-config-cors] for details.

###  Continue wait

If the request takes too long to be processed, Cube Backend responds with
`{ "error": "Continue wait" }` and 200 status code. This is how the long polling
mechanism in Cube is implemented. Clients should continuously retry the same
query in a loop until they get a successful result. Subsequent calls to the Cube
endpoints are idempotent and don't lead to scheduling new database queries if
not required by the [`refresh_key`][ref-schema-ref-cube-refresh-key]. Also,
receiving `Continue wait` doesn't mean the database query has been canceled, and
it's actually still being processed by the Cube. Database queries that weren't
started and are no longer waited by the client's long polling loop will be
marked as orphaned and removed from the querying queue.

Possible reasons of **Continue wait**:

- The query requested is heavy, and it takes some time for the database to
  process it. Clients should wait for its completion, continuously sending the
  same REST API request. [`continueWaitTimeout`][ref-conf-queue-opts] can be
  adjusted in order to change the time Cube waits before returning
  `Continue wait` message.
- There are many queries requested and Cube backend queues them to save database
  from overloading.

###  Error Handling

Cube REST API has basic errors and HTTP Error codes for all requests.

| Status | Error response                 | Description                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | Error message                  | General error. It may be a database error, timeout, or other issue. Check error message for details. |
| 403    | Authorization header isn't set | You didn't provide an auth token. Provide a valid API Token or disable authorization.                |
| 403    | Invalid token                  | The auth token provided is not valid. It may be expired or have invalid signature.                   |
| 500    | Error message                  | Cube internal server error. Check error message for details.                                         |

###  Request Span Annotation

For monitoring tools such as Cube Cloud proper request span annotation should be
provided in `x-request-id` header of a request. Each request id should consist
of two parts: `spanId` and `requestSequenceId` which define `x-request-id` as
whole: `${spanId}-span-${requestSequenceId}`. Values of `x-request-id` header
should be unique for each separate request. `spanId` should define user
interaction span such us `Continue wait` retry cycle and it's value shouldn't
change during one single interaction.

###  Pagination

Cube supports paginated requests for the `/v1/load` endpoint by including
[`limit` and `offset` parameters][ref-api-ref-query-format] in the query. For
example, the following query will retrieve rows 101-200 from the `Orders` cube:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["Orders.status"],
  "measures": ["Orders.count"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Orders.createdAt",
      "dateRange": "last year",
      "granularity": "day"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 100
}
```
