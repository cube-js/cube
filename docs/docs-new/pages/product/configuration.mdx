# Overview

Cube is configured via [environment variables][link-env-vars] and
[configuration options][link-config] in a configuration file. Usually,
both would be used to configure a Cube deployment in production.

## Environment variables

Environment variables are mostly used for configuration that is defined
statically and is not supposed to change while a Cube deployment is running.

<InfoBox>

For example, `CUBEJS_DATASOURCES` defines a list of data sources to connect
to; changing that list would require the deployment to restart.

</InfoBox>

See the [environment variables reference][link-env-vars] for all supported options.

### Cube Core

You can set environment variables in any way [supported by
Docker][link-docker-env-vars], e.g., a `.env` file or the `environment`
option in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Cube Cloud

You can set environment variables in <Btn>Settings → Configuration</Btn>:

## Configuration options

Configuration options are mostly used for configuration that is defined
programmatically and applied dynamically while a Cube deployment is running.

<InfoBox>

For example, [`queryRewrite`](/reference/configuration/config#queryrewrite)
provides a way to inspect, modify, or restrict every query that is being
processed by Cube.

</InfoBox>

Configuration options take precedence over environment variables.
See the [configuration options reference][link-config] for all supported options.

### `cube.py` and `cube.js` files

Configuration options can be defined either using Python, in a `cube.py` file,
or using JavaScript, in a `cube.js` file in the root folder of a Cube project.

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube.conf import config

# Base path for the REST API
config.basePath = '/cube-api'

# Inspect, modify, or restrict every query
@config
def query_rewrite(query, security_context):
  print(query)
  return query
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Base path for the REST API
  basePath: '/cube-api',

  // Inspect, modify, or restrict every query
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    console.log(query);
    return query;
  },
};
```

</CodeTabs>

Both ways are equivalent; when in doubt, use Python.

<InfoBox>

Support for Python and the `cube.py` file was introduced in v0.34.

</InfoBox>

### Cube Core

When using Docker, ensure that the configuration file and your [data model
folder][ref-folder-structure] are mounted to `/cube/conf` within the
Docker container.

### Cube Cloud

You can edit the configuration file by going into <Btn>Development Mode</Btn>
and navigating to the <Btn>Data Model</Btn> page.

## Development Mode

Cube can be run in an insecure, development mode by setting the
`CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` environment variable to `true`. Putting Cube in development
mode does the following:

- Disables authentication checks
- Enables Cube Store in single instance mode
- Enables background refresh for in-memory cache and [scheduled
  pre-aggregations][link-scheduled-refresh]
- Allows another log level to be set (`trace`)
- Enables [Developer Playground][link-dev-playground] on `http://localhost:4000`
- Uses `memory` instead of `cubestore` as the default cache/queue engine
- Logs incorrect/invalid configuration for `externalRefresh` /`waitForRenew`
  instead of throwing errors
- Allows access to non-public cubes and members through the [`/meta`
  endpoint][ref-ref-meta] and for querying through the [REST][ref-rest-api],
  [GraphQL][ref-gql-api] or [SQL][ref-sql-api] APIs.
