# Overview

Cube is configured via [environment variables][link-env-vars] and
[configuration options][link-config] in a configuration file. Usually,
both would be used to configure a Cube deployment in production.

## Environment variables

Environment variables are mostly used for configuration that is defined
statically and is not supposed to change while a Cube deployment is running.

<InfoBox>

For example, `CUBEJS_DATASOURCES` defines a list of data sources to connect
to; changing that list would require the deployment to restart.

</InfoBox>

See the [environment variables reference][link-env-vars] for all supported options.

### Cube Core

You can set environment variables in any way [supported by
Docker][link-docker-env-vars], e.g., a `.env` file or the `environment`
option in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Cube Cloud

You can set environment variables in <Btn>Settings → Configuration</Btn>:

## Configuration options

Configuration options are mostly used for configuration that is defined
programmatically and applied dynamically while a Cube deployment is running.

<InfoBox>

For example, [`query_rewrite`](/reference/configuration/config#query_rewrite)
provides a way to inspect, modify, or restrict every query that is being
processed by Cube.

</InfoBox>

Configuration options take precedence over environment variables.
See the [configuration options reference][link-config] for all supported options.

### `cube.py` and `cube.js` files

Configuration options can be defined either using Python, in a `cube.py` file,
or using JavaScript, in a `cube.js` file in the root folder of a Cube project.

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

# Base path for the REST API
config.base_path = '/cube-api'

# Inspect, modify, or restrict every query
@config('query_rewrite')
def query_rewrite(query: dict, ctx: dict) -> dict:
  if 'order_id' in ctx['securityContext']:
    query['filters'].append({
      'member': 'orders_view.id',
      'operator': 'equals',
      'values': [ctx['securityContext']['order_id']]
    })
  return query
  
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Base path for the REST API
  basePath: '/cube-api',

  // Inspect, modify, or restrict every query
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    if (securityContext.order_id) {
      query.filters.push({
        member: 'orders_view.id',
        operator: 'equals',
        values: [securityContext.order_id]
      });
    }
    return query;
  },
};
```

</CodeTabs>

Both ways are equivalent; when in doubt, use Python.

<InfoBox>

Support for Python and the `cube.py` file was introduced in v0.34.

### Cube Core

When using Docker, ensure that the configuration file and your [data model
folder][ref-folder-structure] are mounted to `/cube/conf` within the
Docker container.

### Cube Cloud

You can edit the configuration file by going into <Btn>Development Mode</Btn>
and navigating to the <Btn>Data Model</Btn> page.

## Runtimes and dependencies

As of v0.34, Cube uses Python v3.9 and Node.js v16.20 as runtime environments
for the code of configuration and [dynamic data models][ref-dynamic-data-models].

It's recommended to use `requirements.txt` and `package.json` files to
specify dependencies for your Python and JavaScript code, respectively.

### Cube Core

If you have specified Python packages in the `requirements.txt` file,
make sure to install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
inside the Docker container.

If you have specified npm packages in the `package.json` file, make sure
to install them by running `npm install` inside the Docker container.
Alternatively, you can run `npm install` on your local machine and mount
the `node_modules` folder under `/cube/conf` in the Docker container;
however, if your dependencies contain native extensions, they might not work
when provided this way.

To automate the installation of dependencies, build and use a [custom
Docker image][ref-custom-docker-image].

### Cube Cloud

Cube Cloud automatically installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` and
`package.json` files.

## Development mode

Cube can be run in an insecure, development mode by setting the
`CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` environment variable to `true`. Putting Cube in development
mode does the following:

- Disables authentication checks
- Enables Cube Store in single instance mode
- Enables background refresh for in-memory cache and [scheduled
  pre-aggregations][link-scheduled-refresh]
- Allows another log level to be set (`trace`)
- Enables [Developer Playground][link-dev-playground] on `http://localhost:4000`
- Uses `memory` instead of `cubestore` as the default cache/queue engine
- Logs incorrect/invalid configuration for `externalRefresh` /`waitForRenew`
  instead of throwing errors
- Allows access to non-public cubes and members through the [`/meta`
  endpoint][ref-ref-meta] and for querying through the [REST][ref-rest-api],
  [GraphQL][ref-gql-api] or [SQL][ref-sql-api] APIs.
