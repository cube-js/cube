# Integration with Prefect

[Prefect][prefect] is a popular open-source orchestrator for data-intensive
workflows. [Prefect Cloud][prefect-cloud] is a fully managed service for
Prefect.

This guide demonstrates how to setup Cube and Prefect to work together so that
Prefect can push changes from upstream data sources to Cube via the
[Orchestration API][ref-orchestration-api].

## Tasks

In Prefect, each workflow is represented by flows, Python functions decorated
with a `@flow` decorator. Flows include calls to tasks, Python functions
decorated with a `@task` decorator, as well as to child flows. Tasks represent
distinct pieces of work executed within a flow. They can perform various jobs:
poll for some precondition, perform extract-load-transform (ETL), or trigger
external systems like Cube.

Integration between Cube and Prefect is enabled by the
[`prefect-cubejs`][github-prefect-cubejs] package.

<InfoBox>

Cube and Prefect integration package was originally contributed by
[Alessandro Lollo](https://github.com/AlessandroLollo), Data Engineering Manager
at Cloud Academy
([case study](https://cube.dev/case-studies/cloud-academy-and-cube)), for which
we're very grateful.

</InfoBox>

The package provides the following tasks:

- `run_query` for querying Cube via the [`/v1/load`][ref-load-endpoint] endpoint
  of the [REST API][ref-rest-api].
- `build_pre_aggregations` for triggering pre-aggregation builds via the
  [`/v1/pre-aggregations/jobs`][ref-ref-jobs-endpoint] endpoint of the
  [Orchestration API][ref-orchestration-api].

Please refer to the [package documentation][github-prefect-cubejs-docs] for
details and options reference.

## Installation

Install [Prefect][prefect-docs-install].

Create a new directory:

```bash
mkdir cube-prefect
cd cube-prefect
```

Install the integration package:

```bash
pip install prefect-cubejs
```

## Configuration

Create a new workflow named `cube_query.py` with the following contents. As you
can see, the `run_query` task accepts a Cube query via the `query` option.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_cubejs.tasks import (
  run_query
)

@flow
def cube_query_workflow():
  run_query(
    url="https://awesome-ecom.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev/cubejs-api",
    api_secret="SECRET",
    query="""{
      "measures": ["Orders.count"],
      "dimensions": ["Orders.status"]
    }"""
  )

cube_query_workflow()
```

Create a new workflow named `cube_build.py` with the following contents. As you
can see, the `build_pre_aggregations` task accepts a pre-aggregation selector
via the `selector` option.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_cubejs.tasks import (
  build_pre_aggregations
)

@flow
def cube_build_workflow():
  build_pre_aggregations(
    url="https://awesome-ecom.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev/cubejs-api",
    api_secret="SECRET",
    selector={
      "contexts": [
        {"securityContext": {}}
      ],
      "timezones": ["UTC"]
    },
    wait_for_job_run_completion=True
  )

cube_build_workflow()
```

## Running workflows

Now, you can run these workflows:

```bash
python cube_query.py
python cube_build.py
```
