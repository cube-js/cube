# Orchestration API

Orchestration API enables Cube to work with data orchestration tools and let
them _push_ changes from upstream data sources to Cube, as opposed to letting
Cube _pull_ changes from upstream data sources via the
[`scheduledRefresh`][ref-scheduled-refresh] configration option of
pre-aggregations.

Orchestration API can be used to implement both [embedded analytics][cube-ea]
and internal or self-serve [business intelligence][cube-issbi] use cases. When
implementing [real-time analytics][cube-rta], consider pulling data from
upstream data sources with [lambda pre-aggregations][ref-lambda-pre-aggs].

Under the hood, the Orchestration API is exposed via the
[`/v1/pre-aggregations/jobs`][ref-ref-jobs-endpoint] endpoint of the [REST
API][ref-rest-api].

## Supported tools

Orchestration API has integration packages to work with popular data
orchestration tools. Check the following guides to get tool-specific
instructions:

## Configuration

Orchestration API is enabled by default but inaccessible due to the default [API
scopes][ref-api-scopes] configuration. To allow access to the Orchestration API,
enable the `jobs` scope, e.g., by setting the `CUBEJS_DEFAULT_API_SCOPES`
environment variable to `meta,data,graphql,jobs`.

## Building pre-aggregations

Orchestration API allows to trigger pre-aggregation builds programmatically. It
can be useful for data orchestration tools to push changes from upstream data
sources to Cube or for any third parties to invalidate and rebuild
pre-aggregations on demand.

You can trigger pre-aggregation builds and check build statuses using the
[`/v1/pre-aggregations/jobs`][ref-ref-jobs-endpoint] endpoint. It is possible to
rebuild:

- All pre-aggregations
- Specific pre-aggregations (e.g., refresh data from some columns)
- Pre-aggregations using specific cubes (e.g., refresh data from some tables)
- Pre-aggregations using cubes from specific data sources (e.g., refresh data
  from some Snowflake connection)
