[pre-aggregations help speed up queries](/product/caching/getting-started-pre-aggregations).
For a deeper dive, take a look at the
[related recipes](/guides/recipes#recipes-query-acceleration).

## Access Control

Cube uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) to
[authenticate requests for the HTTP APIs](/product/auth), and
[`checkSqlAuth()`](/reference/configuration/config#checksqlauth) to
[authenticate requests for the SQL API](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api/security).
