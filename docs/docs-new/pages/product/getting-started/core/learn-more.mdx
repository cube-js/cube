Now that you've set up your first project, learn more about what else Cube can
do for you.

## Data Modeling

## Querying

Cube can be queried in a variety of ways. Explore how to use
[REST API](/reference/rest-api), [GraphQL API](/reference/graphql-api), and
[SQL API](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api), or how to
[connect a BI or data visualization tool](/product/configuration/visualization-tools).

## Caching

Learn more about the [two-level cache](/product/caching) and how
[pre-aggregations help speed up queries](/product/caching/getting-started-pre-aggregations).
For a deeper dive, take a look at the
[related recipes](/guides/recipes/overview#recipes-query-acceleration).

## Access Control

Cube uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) to
[authenticate requests for the HTTP APIs](/product/auth), and
[`checkSqlAuth()`](/reference/configuration/config#checksqlauth) to
[authenticate requests for the SQL API](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api/security).
Cube also supports using JWT claims for securing access to data, check out these
[related recipes](/guides/recipes/overview#recipes-access-control).
