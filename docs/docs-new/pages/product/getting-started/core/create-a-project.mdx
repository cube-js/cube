# Create a project
In this step, we will create a Cube Core project on your computer, connect a
data source, and generate data models.

## Scaffold a project

Start by opening your terminal to create a new folder for the project, then
create a `docker-compose.yml` file within it:

```bash{promptUser: user}
mkdir my-first-cube-project && cd $_
touch docker-compose.yml
```

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following content:

```yaml
version: '2.2'

services:
  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
      - 15432:15432
    environment:
      - CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true
    volumes:
      - .:/cube/conf
```

Note that we're setting the `CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` environment variable to `true` to
enable the [Development Mode](/configuration/overview#development-mode). This is
handy for local development but not suitable for
[production](/deployment/production-checklist).

<InfoBox>

If you're using Linux as the Docker host OS, you'll also need to add
`network_mode: 'host'` to your `docker-compose.yml`.

</InfoBox>

## Start the development server

From the newly-created project directory, run the following command to start
Cube:

```bash{promptUser: user}
docker compose up -d
```

<InfoBox>

Using Windows? Remember to use [PowerShell][powershell-docs] or
[WSL2][wsl2-docs] to run the command below.

</InfoBox>

## Connect a data source

Head to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to open the [Developer
Playground][ref-devtools-playground].

The Playground has a database connection wizard that loads when Cube is first
started up and no `.env` file is found. After database credentials have been set
up, an `.env` file will automatically be created and populated with credentials.

<InfoBox>

Want to use a sample database instead? Select <Btn>PostgreSQL</Btn> and use the
credentials below:

<br />

| Field    | Value              |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Host     | `demo-db.cube.dev` |
| Port     | `5432`             |
| Database | `ecom`             |
| Username | `cube`             |
| Password | `12345`            |

</InfoBox>

After selecting the data source, enter valid credentials for it and
click&nbsp;<Btn>Apply</Btn>. Check the [Connecting to Databases][ref-conf-db]
page for more details on specific data sources.

You should see tables available to you from the configured database; select the
`orders` table. After selecting the table, click&nbsp;<Btn>Generate Data
Model</Btn> and pick either&nbsp;<Btn>YAML</Btn> (recommended)
or&nbsp;<Btn>JavaScript</Btn> format:

Finally, click <Btn>Build</Btn> in the dialog, which should take you to
the&nbsp;<Btn>Build</Btn> page.

You're now ready for the next step, [querying the
data][ref-getting-started-core-query-cube].
