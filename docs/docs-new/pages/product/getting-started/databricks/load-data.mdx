# Load data

The following steps will guide you through setting up a Databricks account and
uploading the demo dataset, which is stored as CSV files in a public S3 bucket.

First, download the following files to your local machine:

- [`line_items.csv`](https://cube-tutorial.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/line_items.csv)
- [`orders.csv`](https://cube-tutorial.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/orders.csv)
- [`users.csv`](https://cube-tutorial.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/users.csv)
- [`products.csv`](https://cube-tutorial.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/products.csv)

Next, let's ensure we have a SQL warehouse that is active. Log in to your
Databricks account, then from the sidebar, click on <Btn>SQL → SQL
Warehouses</Btn>:

Ensure the warehouse is active by checking its status; if it is inactive, click

<Btn>▶️</Btn> to start it.

Next, click <Btn>New → File upload</Btn> from the sidebar, and upload
`line_items.csv`. The UI will show a preview of the data within the file; when
ready, click <Btn>Create table</Btn>.

Repeat the above steps for the three other files.
