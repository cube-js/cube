# Getting started with Cube Core

First, we'll create a new project, connect it to a database and generate a data
model from it. Then, we'll run queries using the Developer Playground and APIs.
Finally, we'll add a pre-aggregation to optimize query latency down to
milliseconds.

This guide will walk you through the following tasks:

- [Create a new project](/product/getting-started/core/create-a-project)
- [Run queries using the Developer Playground and APIs](/product/getting-started/core/query-data)
- [Add a pre-aggregation to optimize query performance](/product/getting-started/core/add-a-pre-aggregation)

If you'd prefer to try Cube Cloud, then you can refer to [Getting Started using
Cube Cloud][ref-getting-started-cloud-overview] instead.
