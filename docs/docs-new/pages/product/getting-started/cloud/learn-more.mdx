# Learn more

Now that you've set up your first deployment, learn more about other Cube Cloud
feaures.

## Access Control

Invite your team to collaborate in Cube Cloud and fine-tune their access to
deployments and features with
[role-based access control](/product/workspace/access-control). You can create
and manage multiple deployments, each with their own set of users.

## Team collaboration

Cube Cloud has a [web-based IDE](/product/workspace/data-model) that can be used
to make changes to data models and test them in a development environment.

You can also connect
[Cube Cloud to Git](/product/deployment/cloud/continuous-deployment) to sync and
deploy from your repository.

## Observability

The [Queries](/product/workspace/query-history) page in Cube Cloud provides
query-level observability, allowing to detect and remedy performance issues with
pre-aggregations where possible.

Cube Cloud also allows [setting up alerts](/product/monitoring/alerts), so you
can be notified if something goes wrong with your deployment.
