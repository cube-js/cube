# Create a deployment

In this step, we will create a new deployment in Cube Cloud. A deployment
represents a data model, configuration, and managed infrastructure. We will use
it to connect a data source and generate data models.

## Create an account

To continue with this guide, you'll need to have a Cube Cloud account. If you
don't have one yet, [click here to sign up][cube-cloud-signup] for free.

## Create a deployment

First, [sign in to your Cube Cloud account][cube-cloud-signin]. Then,
click <Btn>Create Deployment</Btn>:

/>

Give the deployment a name, select the cloud provider and region of your choice,
and click <Btn>Next</Btn>:

<SuccessBox>

Microsoft Azure is available in Cube Cloud on
[Premium](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier. [Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact)
for details.

## Set up a Cube project

Next, click <Btn>Create</Btn> to create a new project from scratch:

/>

## Connect a data source

The last step in creating a deployment is to connect your data source to Cube
Cloud. First, select the data source from the grid:

/>

<InfoBox>

Want to use a sample database instead? Select <Btn>PostgreSQL</Btn> and use the
credentials below:

<br />

| Field    | Value              |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Host     | `demo-db.cube.dev` |
| Port     | `5432`             |
| Database | `ecom`             |
| Username | `cube`             |
| Password | `12345`            |

</InfoBox>

After selecting the data source, enter valid credentials for it and
click <Btn>Apply</Btn>. Check the [Connecting to Databases][ref-conf-db] page
for more details on specific data sources.

/>

If you run into issues here, make sure to allow inbound connections from Cube
Cloud IP addresses to your database. This means you need to enable these IPs in
your firewall. Using the screenshot in the example above, if you are using AWS,
this would mean adding new [rules][aws-docs-sec-group-rule] to your database's
[security group][aws-docs-sec-group]:

| Source          | Protocol | Port range |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `3.65.255.79`   | `TCP`    | `5432`     |
| `3.69.4.168`    | `TCP`    | `5432`     |
| `3.64.153.169`  | `TCP`    | `5432`     |
| `18.185.128.84` | `TCP`    | `5432`     |

Now that the deployment is configured, we can move on to [generating data
models][ref-getting-started-cloud-generate-models].
