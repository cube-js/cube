## List all roles

To see a list of roles in your account, first go to the Team settings page by

button.

On the Team settings page, click the "Roles" tab to see all the roles in your

## Create a role

To create a new role, click the "Add Role" button. Enter a name and optional
description for the role, then click "Add Policy" and select either "Deployment"
or "Global" for this policy's scope.

Deployment policies apply to deployment-level functionality, such as the
Playground and Data Model editor. Global policies apply to account-level
functionality, such as Alerts and Billing. Once the policy scope has been
selected, you can restrict which actions this role can perform by selecting
"Specific" and using the dropdown to select specific actions.
