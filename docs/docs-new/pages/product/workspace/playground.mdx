# Playground

Playground is a web-based tool which allows executing queries and previewing
their results.

<SuccessBox>

Playground is available in Cube Cloud on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

Cube Core and Cube Cloud both provide the Playground experience; however, a few
additional features are available in Cube Cloud.

## Running Playground

### Cube Core

Playground is available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) when
Cube is run in [development mode][ref-dev-mode], i.e., when `CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` is
set to `true`.

<WarningBox>

Since Playground exposes all data models and allows running all possible
queries, it should not be used in production. You can use the
[JavaScript SDKs](/product/frontend-integrations/introduction) to build your own
query builder and use it to query your Cube API in a secure way.

</WarningBox>

### Cube Cloud

Playground is available out of the box to authenticated [Cube Cloud][cube-cloud]
users.

When editing the data model through the [Cube IDE][ref-devtools-ide], Playground
will switch to the Development API and its status will be visible in the
Playground:

/>

## Query tabs

You can use query tabs to keep results of previous queries while still being
able to make new queries. The query tabs can be found at the top of the
Developer Playground:

/>

## Editing the Security Context

The security context used for queries can be modified by clicking <Btn>Add
Security Context</Btn>:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/06bece10-f322-4b4a-9250-234d1bae98db/" />

You can paste in an existing JWT if desired; or create a brand-new one by
providing a JSON object that represents the decoded JWT.

## Executing generated SQL

To see the SQL generated by a query, click <Btn>Generated SQL</Btn>:

If you're using Cube Cloud, you can copy this SQL and run it in your data source
using the [SQL Runner][ref-workspace-sqlrunner].

## Using the Rollup Designer

The Rollup Designer provides an easy way to create and edit
[pre-aggregations][ref-caching-preaggs-gs] from within the Playground. For
example, when you execute a query that has no matching pre-aggregations, the
Playground also displays some information above the results:

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(58% 16% 37% 49% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/4698a6c7-b77e-41ec-8866-3611d6a6e073/"
/>

Clicking <Btn>Query was not accelerated with pre-aggregation</Btn> will open the
Rollup Designer with a suggested pre-aggregation that will accelerate the query:

If desired, you can also modify settings such as the [refresh
key][ref-preaggs-ref-refreshkey], the [partition
granularity][ref-preaggs-ref-partitiongranularity], and
[indexes][ref-preaggs-ref-indexes] to further optimize the pre-aggregation by
clicking the ​<Btn>Settings</Btn> tab:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/27afed37-10ae-4948-bf3f-4261f6e0663c/" />

Click <Btn>Add to the Data Schema</Btn> to add the pre-aggregation to the data
model. You can then run the query again to see the results:

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(52% 15% 42% 52% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/e75a39a7-db3f-479f-a606-4680d04dd5d0/"
/>
