# Development mode

Development mode allows to test and debug the data model in an isolated
environment before releasing any changes to production. When the development
mode is enabled, a new set of API endpoints is deployed specifically for the
branch.

<SuccessBox>

Development mode is available in Cube Cloud on
[all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

## Finding endpoints

After entering Development Mode, go to the Overview page to see all available
endpoints for the branch:

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    alt="Development Mode Overview page showing available endpoints"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/85d92844-09bd-4254-a87c-e19ae6989da5/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Limitations

The Development API has some limitations compared to Production, and it is
important to be aware of these as they may affect your development process.

###  Autoscaling

The Development API **does not** support autoscaling. If you need to test
autoscaling, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a different Git
branch of the same repository.

###  Scheduled refresh

Scheduled refresh is also disabled in the Development API. If you need to test
scheduled refreshes, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a
different Git branch of the same repository.

###  Cube version guarantees

The version of Cube used in the Development API **is not** guaranteed to be the
same each time. If this affects your development process, we recommend reaching
out to our support team.
