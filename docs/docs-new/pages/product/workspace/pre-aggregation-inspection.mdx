# Pre-aggregation inspection
The Pre-Aggregations page in Cube Cloud allows you to inspect all
[pre-aggregations][ref-caching-gs-preaggs] in your deployment at a glance. You
can see which pre-aggregations are accelerating queries, if they are [being
refreshed][ref-caching-using-preaggs-refresh], along with the last 24 hours of
build history.

## Exploring pre-aggregations

You can switch between [pre-aggregations](#pre-aggregations) and
[build history](#build-history) by switching between the&nbsp;
&ZeroWidthSpace;<Btn>Pre-Aggregations</Btn> and <Btn>Build History</Btn> tabs.

## Pre-aggregations

The <Btn>Pre-Aggregations</Btn> tab shows a list of all configured
[pre-aggregations][ref-caching-gs-preaggs] for the deployment, and is useful for
quickly checking details such as when the last build occurred, how long the
build took to complete, the total size of the pre-aggregated data, and how many
partitions the data is split across. To see more information about a specific
pre-aggregation, click on it.

###  Partitions

The <Btn>Partitions</Btn> tab shows all partitions (as specified by
[`partitionGranularity`][ref-model-ref-preaggs-partition-granularity]) of the
pre-aggregation. In the example below, the pre-aggregation has a single
partition:

Pre-aggregations with multiple partitions show a list of all partitions, which
is helpful for checking pre-aggregation partition build times and sizes:

Ideally partitions should be of a similar size and build time. If a partition is
taking significantly longer to build than others, it may be worth investigating
why.

If the pre-aggregation requires rebuilding (usually due to the underlying data
changing in a significant way), clicking <Btn>Build All</Btn> rebuilds **all**
partitions of the pre-aggregation:

/>

You can also choose to rebuild **specific** partitions by selecting them and
then clicking the <Btn>Build Selected</Btn> button:

/>

###  Definition

The <Btn>Definition</Btn> tab shows how the [pre-aggregation is defined in the
data model][ref-model-ref-preaggs] without having to switch to the <Btn>Data
Model</Btn> page:

###  Preview

To see a sample of the data contained in the pre-aggregation, click the&nbsp;
&ZeroWidthSpace;<Btn>Preview</Btn> tab:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/7f5059bb-3bc9-492e-9c69-3b614f3feca5/" />

This can be used to verify that the data within the pre-aggregation is being
built correctly.

###  Used By

The <Btn>Used By</Btn> tab shows recent queries that used this pre-aggregation
for acceleration:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/1dcef348-af33-434a-9ef7-7a4c5f30c26c/" />

This is especially useful for checking that the pre-aggregation is being used as
expected by queries sent to the deployment.

###  Indexes

[Indexes][ref-model-ref-preaggs-index] significantly improve the performance of
configured pre-aggregations. The <Btn>Indexes</Btn> tab displays any configured
indexes for this pre-aggregation:

## Build History

The <Btn>Build History</Btn> tab shows the last 24 hours of build history for
all pre-aggregations in the deployment. From here, you can see if a
pre-aggregation build succeeded (or failed), how the build was triggered, when
the build started, and how long it took to complete.
