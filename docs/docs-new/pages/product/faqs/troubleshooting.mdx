# Troubleshooting

## Error: Unsupported db type: undefined

This error message might mean that there's no `CUBEJS_DB_TYPE` defined. Please
visit **Settings > Configuration** and define this environment variable.

If this doesn't help, please reach out to us in our support chat, we'd be happy
to help!

## Error: Internal: deadline has elapsed OR Error: Query execution timeout after 10 min of waiting

This error happens when a query remains queued for an excessive amount of time.
To troubleshoot, try increasing concurrency and/or timeout limits. The default
concurrency is 4 for most data warehouses and the default timeout is 10 minutes.
You can increase these values by adjusting the `CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY` or
`CUBEJS_DB_TIMEOUT` environment variables in **Settings > Configuration**. If
your timeout limit is already high, we recommend either adding a pre-aggregation
or refactoring your SQL for better efficiency.

If these methods don't help, please reach out to us in our support chat!

## Error: Error during create table: CREATE TABLE with pre-aggregations

This usually means Cube can't create a pre-aggregation table, which could be due
to a few different reasons. Further down the error log, you should see more
details which will help narrow down the scope of the issue.

## Warning: There were queries in these timezones which are not added in the CUBEJS_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_TIMEZONES environment variable.

If you want your query to use pre-aggregations, you must define all necessary
timezones using either the `CUBEJS_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_TIMEZONES` environment
variable, or in the `cube.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // You can define one or multiple timezones based on your requirements
  scheduledRefreshTimeZones: ["America/Vancouver", "America/Toronto"],
};
```

Without this configuration, Cube will default to `UTC`. The warning reflects
Cube's inability to find the query's timezone in the desired pre-aggregation.

## Cube Cloud API is down after upgrading the version of Cube

You may roll back to a previous Cube version at any time in **Settings >
Configuration**.

We always recommend testing new Cube versions in your staging environment before
updating your production environment. We do not recommend setting your
production deployment to the latest version since it will automatically upgrade
to the latest version every time it's released on the next build or settings
update.
