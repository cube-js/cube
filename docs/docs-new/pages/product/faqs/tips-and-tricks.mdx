# Tips and Tricks

## How can I read from two different database schemas in my database when I'm only able to select one while connecting?

Use your first schema when setting up your database connection in Cube Cloud.

To use your second database schema, update the `CUBE_DB_NAME` environment
variable in **Settings > Configuration**. Change `CUBE_DB_NAME` to the name of
your second schema.

This will trigger a new build. Once it's completed click on <Btn>Data
Model</Btn> in the left hand side navigation, and then in the upper-right
corner, click the three-dot menu and select <Btn>Generate Data Model</Btn>. You
should be able to see the name of the second schema from your database and
generate new models.

## Can I track my customers' query usage?

You can track query usage by user (or other dimension) by setting up [Log
Export][ref-cloud-o11y-logs] and parsing the necessary information.

## Can I bypass Row-Level Security when using the SQL API?

There may be times when you want the permissions through Cube's REST API to be
different from the permissions of the SQL API.

For example, perhaps your customers use the REST API to access their own data.
You might use row-level security to prevent them from seeing any data associated
with other customers.

For your internal analytics, you could provide access to your Data Analysts via
the SQL API. Since this is for your internal use, you will need access to all
the data rather than a single customer's. To give yourself higher permissions
through the SQL API, you could create an exception for the usual Row-Level
Security checks.

In the following data models, we have created some example Row-Level Security
rules and an exception for querying data via the SQL API.

### Defining basic RLS

First, in the `cube.js` configuration file, we'll define the
[`queryRewrite()`][ref-conf-ref-queryrewrite] property to push a filter to each
query depending on the `tenantId` within the [Security Context][ref-sec-ctx].

```javascript
module.exports = {
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    if (!securityContext.tenantId) {
      throw new Error("No id found in Security Context!");
    } else {
      query.filters.push({
        member: "orders.tenant_id",
        operator: "equals",
        values: [securityContext.tenantId],
      });

      return query;
    }
  },
};
```

With this logic, each tenant can see their data and nothing else.

### Bypassing RLS for queries created with the SQL API

When we want to bypass the RLS we defined above, we need to create a sort of
"superuser" only accessible when authenticating via the SQL API. We need to
define two new things for this to work:

1.  Leverage the [`checkSqlAuth()`][ref-conf-ref-checksqlauth] configuration
    option to inject a new property into the Security Context that defines a
    superuser. In this case, we'll call it `isSuperUser`.

2.  Handle the new `isSuperUser` property in our previously defined
    `queryRewrite` to bypass the filter push.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Create a "superuser" security context for the SQL API
  checkSqlAuth: async (req, username) => {
    if (username === process.env.CUBEJS_SQL_USER) {
      return {
        password: process.env.CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD,
        securityContext: { isSuperUser: true },
      };
    }
  },
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    // Bypass row-level-security when connected from the SQL API
    if (securityContext.isSuperUser) {
      return query;
    } else if (!securityContext.tenantId) {
      throw new Error("No id found in Security Context!");
    } else {
      query.filters.push({
        member: "orders.tenant_id",
        operator: "equals",
        values: [securityContext.tenantId],
      });

      return query;
    }
  },
};
```

With this exception in place we should be able to query all the customers' data
via the SQL API without being hindered by the row-level security checks.
