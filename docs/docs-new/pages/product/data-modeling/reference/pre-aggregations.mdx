# Pre-aggregations
Pre-aggregations are materialized query results persisted as tables. Cube has an
ability to analyze queries against a defined set of pre-aggregation rules in
order to choose the optimal one that will be used to create pre-aggregation
table.

If Cube finds a suitable pre-aggregation rule, database querying becomes a
multi-stage process:

1. Cube checks if an up-to-date copy of the pre-aggregation exists.

2. Cube will execute a query against the pre-aggregated tables instead of the
   raw data.

Pre-aggregations can be defined in the `pre_aggregations` available on each cube.
A more in-depth diagram detailing how pre-aggregations are selected can be
[found here][ref-caching-preaggs-selecting-preaggs].

Pre-aggregations must have, at minimum, a name and a type. Pre-aggregations must
include all dimensions, measures, and filters you will query with.

## Parameters

###  name

The `name` parameter serves as the identifier of a pre-aggregation. It must be
unique among all pre-aggregations within a cube and follow the [naming
conventions][ref-naming].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_status: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      measures: [CUBE.count],
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_status
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
```

</CodeTabs>

This `name`, along with the name of the cube, will be used as a prefix for
pre-aggregation tables created in the database.

###  type

Cube supports the following types of pre-aggregations:

- [`rollup`][self-rollup]
- [`original_sql`][self-originalsql]
- [`rollup_join`][self-rollupjoin]
- [`rollup_lambda`][self-rolluplambda]

The default type is `rollup`.

<h4 id="parameters-type-rollup">rollup</h4>

Rollup pre-aggregations are the most effective way to boost performance of any
analytical application. The blazing fast performance of tools like Google
Analytics or Mixpanel are backed by a similar concept. The theory behind it lies
in multi-dimensional analysis, and a rollup pre-aggregation is the result of a
[roll-up operation on an OLAP cube][wiki-olap-ops]. A rollup pre-aggregation is
essentially the summarized data of the original cube grouped by any selected
dimensions of interest.

The most performant kind of rollup pre-aggregation is an **additive** rollup:
all measures of which are based on [decomposable aggregate
functions][wiki-composable-agg-fn]. Additive measure types are: `count`, `sum`,
`min`, `max` or `count_distinct_approx`. The performance boost in this case is
based on two main properties of additive rollup pre-aggregations:

1. A rollup pre-aggregation table usually contains many fewer rows than its'
   corresponding original fact table. The fewer dimensions that are selected for
   roll-up means fewer rows in the materialized result. A smaller number of rows
   therefore means less time to query rollup pre-aggregation tables.

2. If your query is a subset of dimensions and measures of an additive rollup,
   then it can be used to calculate a query without accessing the raw data. The
   more dimensions and measures are selected for roll-up, the more queries can
   use this particular rollup.

Rollup definitions can contain members from a single cube as well as from
multiple cubes. In case of multiple cubes being involved, the join query will be
built according to the standard rules of cubes joining.

Rollups are selected for querying based on properties found in queries made to
the Cube REST API. A thorough explanation can be found under [Getting Started
with Pre-Aggregations][ref-caching-preaggs-target].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_company: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_company
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
```

</CodeTabs>

<h4 id="parameters-type-originalsql">original_sql</h4>

As the name suggests, it persists the results of the `sql` property of the cube.
Pre-aggregations of type `original_sql` should **only** be used when the cube's
`sql` is a complex query (i.e. nested, window functions and/or multiple joins).

<WarningBox>

`originalSql` pre-aggregations **must only** be used when [storing
pre-aggregations in the source database][ref-caching-using-preaggs-internal].
While you can set `external: true` for `original_sql` pre-aggregation, this is
not recommended or generally supported.

</WarningBox>

They often do not provide much in the way of performance directly, but there are
two specific applications:

1. They can be used in tandem with the
   [`use_original_sql_pre_aggregations`][self-origsql-preaggs] option in other
   rollup pre-aggregations.

2. Situations where it is not possible to use a `rollup` pre-aggregations, such
   as [funnels][ref-recipe-funnels].

For example, to pre-aggregate all completed orders, you could do the following:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`completed_orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE completed = true
  `,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `original_sql`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: completed_orders
    sql: >
      SELECT *
      FROM orders
      WHERE completed = true
    
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        type: original_sql
```

</CodeTabs>

<h4 id="parameters-type-rollupjoin">rollup_join</h4>

<WarningBox heading={`🐣  Preview`}>

`rollup_join` is currently in Preview, and the API may change in a future
version.

</WarningBox>

<WarningBox>

Rollup join can be used only to join two tables, and one can't contain more than
one partition so that the join can operate correctly. It means that at least one
table should be less than 1M of rows. There's work in progress to remove those
limitations.

</WarningBox>

Cube is capable of performing joins between pre-aggregations from different
[data sources][ref-schema-ref-cube-datasource] to avoid making excessive queries
to them.

<WarningBox>

`rollup_join` is an ephemeral pre-aggregation that relies on referenced rollups when
queries are executed. Setting
[`scheduled_refresh`](#parameters-scheduled-refresh) to `true` is unnecessary for
`rollup_join` and will result in an error. Appropriate freshness controls should
be set on referenced rollups instead.

</WarningBox>

In the following example, we have a `users` cube with a `users_rollup`
pre-aggregation, and an `orders` cube with an `orders_rollup` pre-aggregation,
and an `orders_with_users_rollup` pre-aggregation. Note the following:

- Both cubes have different values for `data_source`.
- The type of `orders_with_users_rollup` is `rollup_join`.
- This pre-aggregation has a special property `rollups` which is an array
  containing references to both "source" rollups.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  data_source: `postgres`,
  sql_table: `users`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {

<InfoBox>

`rollup_join` is not required to join cubes from the same data source; instead,
include the foreign cube's dimensions/measures in the rollup definition
directly:

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],

</CodeTabs>

<h4 id="parameters-type-rolluplambda">rollup_lambda</h4>

<WarningBox>

`rollup_lambda` pre-aggregations **must** be defined **before** any other
pre-aggregations in a cube.

</WarningBox>

A `rollup_lambda` pre-aggregation is a special type of pre-aggregation that can
combine data from data sources and other rollups. It is extremely useful in
scenarios where real-time data is required.

[Lambda pre-aggregations][ref-caching-lambda-preaggs] can be used to combine
data from a data source and a pre-aggregation, or even from multiple
pre-aggregations across different cubes that share the same dimensions
and measures.

###  measures

The `measures` property is an array of [measures from the
cube][ref-schema-measures] that should be included in the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders
    
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup
        measures:
          - CUBE.count

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
```

</CodeTabs>

###  dimensions

The `dimensions` property is an array of [dimensions from the
cube][ref-schema-dimensions] that should be included in the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `status`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders
        
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status

    dimensions:
      - name: status
        type: string
        sql: status
```

</CodeTabs>

###  time_dimension

The `time_dimension` property can be any [`dimension`][ref-schema-dimensions] of
type [`time`][ref-schema-types-dim-time]. All other measures and dimensions in
the data model are aggregated. This property is an extremely useful tool for
improving performance with massive datasets.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_status: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `status`,
    },

    created_at: {
      type: `time`,
      sql: `created_at`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders
        
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_status
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: status
        type: string
        sql: status

      - name: created_at
        type: time
        sql: created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

A [`granularity`][self-granularity] **must** also be included in the
pre-aggregation definition.

###  granularity

The `granularity` property defines the granularity of data _within_ the
pre-aggregation. If set to `week`, for example, then Cube will pre-aggregate the
data by week and persist it to Cube Store.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup_by_week: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `week`,
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup_by_week
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: week
```

</CodeTabs>

The value can be one of `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`,
`quarter` or `year`. This property is required when using
[`time_dimension`][self-timedimension].

###  segments

The `segments` property is an array of [segments from the
cube][ref-schema-segments] that can target the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      segments: [CUBE.only_complete],
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  segments: {
    only_complete: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders
    
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        segments:
          - CUBE.only_complete

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
    
    segments:
      - name: only_complete
        sql: "{CUBE}.status = 'completed'"
```

</CodeTabs>

###  partition_granularity

The `partition_granularity` defines the granularity for each
[partition][ref-caching-partitioning] of the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`,
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

The value can be one of `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`. A
[`time_dimension`][self-timedimension] and [`granularity`][self-granularity]
**must** also be included in the pre-aggregation definition. This property is
required when using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning].

Number of partitions to be built per cube is calculated as
[build_range][self-buildrange] divided by `partition_granularity`. Number of
partitions to be built per cube is multiplied by the count of time zones and
tenants in case different tenants have different pre-aggregation SQL.

<WarningBox>

Choose the count of partitions wisely as those consume memory and CPU resources.
As a rule of thumb, you do not want to go over 5,000-10,000 partitions in total
to keep the partitioning overhead low. Too many partitions will most likely
cause out of memory.

</WarningBox>

###  refresh_key

Cube can also take care of keeping pre-aggregations up to date with the
`refresh_key` property. By default, it is set to `every: '1 hour'`.

<InfoBox>

When using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning], the refresh
key is evaluated for each partition separately.

</InfoBox>

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-sql">sql</h4>

You can set up a custom refresh check strategy by using the `sql` property:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refresh_key: {
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        refresh_key:
          sql: SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders
    
    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

In the above example, the refresh key SQL will be executed every 10 seconds, as
[`every`][self-refreshkey-every] is not defined. If the results of the SQL
refresh key differ from the last execution, then the pre-aggregation will be
refreshed.

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-every">every</h4>

The `refresh_key` can define an `every` property which can be used to refresh
pre-aggregations based on a time interval. By default, it is set to `1 hour`
unless the [`sql` property][self-refreshkey-sql] is also defined, in which case
it is set to `10 seconds`. For example:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refresh_key: {
        every: `1 day`,
      },
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 day

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

For possible `every` parameter values please refer to
[`refreshKey`][ref-cube-refreshkey] documentation.

You can also use `every` with `sql`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 hour`,
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 hour
          sql: SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders
```

</CodeTabs>

In the above example, the refresh key SQL will be executed every hour. If the
results of the SQL refresh key differ from the last execution, then the
pre-aggregation will be refreshed.

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-incremental">incremental</h4>

You can incrementally refresh partitioned rollups by setting
`incremental: true`. This option defaults to `false`.

<WarningBox>

Partition tables are refreshed as a whole. When a new partition table is
available, it replaces the old one. Old partition tables are collected by a
garbage collection mechanism. Append is never used to add new rows to the
existing tables.

</WarningBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-updatewindow">update_window</h4>

<WarningBox>

Incremental refreshes without a defined `update_window` will only update the last
partition as determined by the pre-aggregation's `partition_granularity`.

</WarningBox>

The `incremental: true` flag generates a special `refresh_key` SQL query which
triggers a refresh for partitions where the end date lies within the
`update_window` from the current time.

<WarningBox>

Because incremental refreshes generate their own SQL, you **must not** use the
[`sql`](#parameters-refresh-key-sql) property here.

</WarningBox>

In the example below, it will refresh today's and the last 7 days of partitions
once a day. Partitions before the `7 day` interval **will not** be refreshed
once they are built unless the rollup SQL is changed.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
      refresh_key: {
        every: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
        update_window: `7 day`,
      },
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: day
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 day
          incremental: true
          update_window: 7 day
    
    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

This property is required when using [`incremental`][self-incremental]
refreshes.

### allow_non_strict_date_range_match

The `allow_non_strict_date_range_match` property can be used to allow queries to
match this pre-aggregation when using non-strict date ranges. This is useful
when using a visualization tools such as [Apache
Superset][ref-config-downstream-superset] that use loose date ranges by default.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measure: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
      allow_non_strict_date_range_match: true,
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measure:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: day
        allow_non_strict_date_range_match: true
```

</CodeTabs>

###  use_original_sql_pre_aggregations

Cube supports multi-stage pre-aggregations by reusing original SQL
pre-aggregations in rollups through the `use_original_sql_pre_aggregations`
property. It is helpful in cases where you want to re-use a heavy SQL query
calculation in multiple `rollup` pre-aggregations. Without
`use_original_sql_pre_aggregations` enabled, Cube will always re-execute all
underlying SQL calculations every time it builds new rollup tables.

<WarningBox>

`original_sql` pre-aggregations **must only** be used when [storing
pre-aggregations in the source database][ref-caching-using-preaggs-internal].
This also means that `original_sql` pre-aggregations require `readOnly: false` to
be set on their respective database driver.

</WarningBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT * FROM orders1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM orders2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM orders3
  `,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `original_sql`,
    },

    statuses: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true,
    },

    completed_orders: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.completed_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true,
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM orders1
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM orders2
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM orders3

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        type: original_sql

      - name: statuses
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true

      - name: completed_orders
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.completed_at
        granularity: day
        use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

###  scheduled_refresh

To always keep pre-aggregations up-to-date, you can set
`scheduled_refresh: true`. This option defaults to `true`. If set to `false`,
pre-aggregations will always be built on-demand. The
[`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] is used to determine if there's a need to update
specific pre-aggregations on each scheduled refresh run. For partitioned
pre-aggregations, `min` and `max` dates for
[`time_dimension`][self-timedimension] are checked to determine range for the
refresh.

Each time a scheduled refresh is run, it takes every pre-aggregation partition
starting with most recent ones in time and checks if the
[`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] has changed. If a change was detected, then that
partition will be refreshed.

In development mode, Cube runs the background refresh by default and will
refresh all pre-aggregations which have `scheduled_refresh: true`.

Please consult [Production Checklist][ref-production-checklist-refresh] for best
practices on running background refresh in production environments.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_status: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`,
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_status
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month
    
    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

###  build_range_start and build_range_end

<WarningBox>

Currently `build_range_start` and `build_range_end` doesn't have any effect on
pre-aggregations without `partition_granularity`. This behavior can be changed in
future versions.

</WarningBox>

<WarningBox>

Cube will **not** return results outside of the defined build range. Data will
**only** be queried within this range, which can lead to an empty result set,
depending on the query. Consider using [Lambda
pre-aggregations][self-rolluplambda] if you want to query data outside of the
build range.

</WarningBox>

The build range defines what partitions should be built by a scheduled refresh.
By default, the build range is defined as the minimum and maximum values
possible for the [`time_dimension`][self-timedimension] used in the rollup.

<InfoBox>

The SQL queries for the build range (as defined by the `sql` property) are
executed based on the [`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] settings of the
pre-aggregation.

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`,
      build_range_start: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '300 day'`,
      },
      build_range_end: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '300 day'
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT NOW()
    
    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

It can be used together with the pre-aggregation's `refresh_key` to define
granular update settings. Set `refresh_key.update_window` to the interval in which
your data can change and `build_range_start` to the earliest point of time when
history should be available.

In the following example, `refresh_key.update_window` is `1 week` and
`build_range_start` is `SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '365 day'`, so the scheduled
refresh will build historical partitions for 365 days in the past and will only
refresh last week's data.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`,
      build_range_start: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '365 day'`,
      },
      build_range_end: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
      refresh_key: {
        update_window: `1 week`,
      },
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '365 day'
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT NOW()
        refresh_key:
          update_window: 1 week
```

</CodeTabs>

###  union_with_source_data

This option allows combining a pre-aggregation with fresh data retrieved from
the data source; this is extremely useful in scenarios where latency can be
sacrificed for accuracy.

To configure a pre-aggregation to behave in this way, ensure the pre-aggregation
is of type `rollup_lambda`, and then set `union_with_source_data` to `true`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    lambda: {
      type: `rollup_lambda`,
      union_with_source_data: true,
      rollups: [orders.main],
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: lambda
        type: rollup_lambda
        union_with_source_data: true
        rollups:
          - orders.main
```

</CodeTabs>

###  indexes

In case of pre-aggregation tables having significant cardinality, you might want
to create indexes for them in databases which support it. This can be done as
follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    category_and_date: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.category],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        category_index: {
          columns: [CUBE.category],
        },
      },
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: category_and_date
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.category
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        indexes:
          - name: category_index
            columns:
              - CUBE.category

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

To maximize performance, you can introduce an index per query, so the set of
dimensions used in the query is the same as in the index. There's no need to
define measure columns in the index. The index column order is the sort order of
all data within the index. Under the hood, Cube Store will create table dataset
copy and will sort it according to index specification. Cube Store works best
when you define all your `equals` filter dimensions first and all dimensions
from `GROUP BY` last. For range filter columns like `contains`, `>`, `<`, `>=`,
`<=` with high selectivity, typically less than 5% of records keep those columns
before `GROUP BY` dimensions. Otherwise, for low selectivity range filters,
consider putting these columns after `GROUP BY` dimensions.

For `original_sql` pre-aggregations, the original column names as strings can be
used:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `original_sql`,
      indexes: {
        timestamp_index: {
          columns: ["timestamp"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        type: original_sql
        indexes:
          - name: timestamp_index
            columns:
              - timestamp
```

</CodeTabs>

###  Aggregating indexes

Cube Store also supports aggregating indexes that contain **only** specified
columns and pre-aggregated measures in the pre-aggregation definition.
[Queries][ref-api-ref-query-ref] that can target aggregating indexes must have
the following characteristics:

1. They cannot make use of any `filters` other than for those dimensions that
   are included in that index
2. **All** dimensions used in the query must be defined in the aggregating index

Queries that do not have the above can still make use of regular indexes so
performance can still be optimized.

Basically, the aggregating index is a rollup of data in a rollup table itself.
Data needs to be downloaded from the source DB as many times as many rollups you
have. Given that having a single rollup and multiple aggregate indexes gives you
pretty much the same performance from the Cube Store side but multiple times
less cost from a data warehouse perspective.

Aggregating indexes can be defined by adding `type: 'aggregate'` to the index
definition:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,
  
  pre_aggregations: {
    category_and_date: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        category_index: {
          columns: [CUBE.status, products.name],
        },
        aggregated_index: {
          columns: [CUBE.status],
          type: `aggregate`,
        },
      },
    },
  },

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: category_and_date
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        indexes:
          - name: category_index
            columns:
              - CUBE.status
              - Products.name
          - name: aggregated_index
            columns:
              - CUBE.status
            type: aggregate

    # ...
```
