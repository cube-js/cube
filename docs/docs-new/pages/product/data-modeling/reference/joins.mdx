# Joins

The `joins` parameter declares a block to define relationships between cubes. It
allows users to access and compare fields from two or more cubes at the same
time.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`my_cube`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    target_cube: {
      relationship: `one_to_one` || `one_to_many` || `many_to_one`,
      sql: `SQL ON clause`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: my_cube
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: target_cube
        relationship: one_to_one || one_to_many || many_to_one
        sql: SQL ON clause
```

</CodeTabs>

All joins are generated as `LEFT JOIN`. The cube which defines the join serves
as a main table, and any cubes referenced inside the `joins` property are used
in the `LEFT JOIN` clause. Learn more about direction of joins
[here][ref-schema-fundamentals-join-dir].

The semantics of `INNER JOIN` can be achieved with additional filtering. For
example, a simple check of whether the column value `IS NOT NULL` by using [set
filter][ref-restapi-query-filter-op-set] satisfies this requirement.

There's also no way to define `FULL OUTER JOIN` and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` for the
sake of join modeling simplicity. To get `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` semantics just
define join [from other side of relationship][ref-schema-fundamentals-join-dir].
The `FULL OUTER JOIN` can be built inside cube [sql][ref-schema-cube-sql]
parameter. Quite frequently, `FULL OUTER JOIN` is used to solve [Data
Blending][ref-schema-data-blenging] or similar problems. In that case, it's best
practice to have a separate cube for such an operation.

## Parameters

### name

The name must match the name of the joined cube and, thus, follow the [naming
conventions][ref-naming].

For example, when the `products` cube is joined on to the `orders` cube, we
would define the join as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    products: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE.id} = ${products.order_id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: products
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE.id} = {products.order_id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

### relationship

The `relationship` property is used to describe the type of the relationship
between joined cubes. It’s important to properly define the type of relationship
so Cube can accurately calculate measures.

The cube that declares the join is considered _left_ in terms of the [left
join][wiki-left-join] semantics, and the joined cube is considered _right_. It
means that all rows of the _left_ cube are selected, while only those rows of
the _right_ cube that match the condition are selected as well. For more
information and specific examples, please see [join
directions][ref-schema-fundamentals-join-dir].

<InfoBox>

The join does not need to be defined on both cubes, but the definition can
affect the [join direction][ref-schema-fundamentals-join-dir].

</InfoBox>

You can use the following types of relationships:

- `one_to_one` for [one-to-one][wiki-1-1] relationships
- `one_to_many` for [one-to-many][wiki-1-m] relationships
- `many_to_one` for the opposite of [one-to-many][wiki-1-m] relationships

<WarningBox>

The types of relationships listed above were introduced in v0.32.19 for clarity
as they are commonly used in the data space. The following aliases were used
before and are still valid, so there's no need to update existing data models:

- `one_to_one` was known as `has_one` or `hasOne`
- `one_to_many` was known as `has_many` or `hasMany`
- `many_to_one` was known as `belongs_to` or `belongsTo`

</WarningBox>

#### One-to-one

The `one_to_one` type indicates a [one-to-one][wiki-1-1] relationship between
the declaring cube and the joined cube. It means that one row in the declaring
cube can match only one row in the joined cube.

For example, in a data model containing `users` and their `profiles`, the
`users` cube would declare the following join:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    profiles: {
      relationship: `one_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${profiles.user_id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: profiles
        relationship: one_to_one
        sql: "{users}.id = {profiles.user_id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

#### One-to-many

The `one_to_many` type indicates a [one-to-many][wiki-1-m] relationship between
the declaring cube and the joined cube. It means that one row in the declaring
cube can match many rows in the joined cube.

For example, in a data model containing `authors` and the `books` they have
written, the `authors` cube would declare the following join:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`authors`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    books: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${books.author_id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: authors
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: books
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{authors}.id = {books.author_id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

#### Many-to-one

The `many_to_one` type indicates the many-to-one relationship between the
declaring cube and the joined cube. You’ll often find this type of relationship
on the opposite side of the [one-to-many][wiki-1-m] relationship. It means that
one row in the declaring cube matches a single row in the joined cube, while a
row in the joined cube can match many rows in the declaring cube.

For example, in a data model containing `orders` and `customers` who made them,
the `orders` cube would have the following join:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    customers: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_id = ${customers.id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: customers
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{orders}.customer_id = {customers.id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

### sql

`sql` is necessary to indicate a related column between cubes. It is important
to properly specify a matching column when creating joins. Take a look at the
example below:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    customers: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      // The `customer_id` column of the `orders` cube corresponds to the
      // `id` dimension of the `customers` cube
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_id = ${customers.id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: customers
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{orders}.customer_id = {customers.id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

## Setting a primary key

In order for a join to work, it is necessary to define a `primary_key` as
specified below. It is a requirement when a join is defined so that Cube can
handle row multiplication issues.

Let's imagine you want to calculate `Order Amount` by `Order Item Product Name`.
In this case, `Order` rows will be multiplied by the `Order Item` join due to
the `one_to_many` relationship. In order to produce correct results, Cube will
select distinct primary keys from `Order` first and then will join these primary
keys with `Order` to get the correct `Order Amount` sum result. Please note that
`primary_key` should be defined in the `dimensions` section.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    customer_id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: customer_id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
```

</CodeTabs>

<InfoBox>

Setting `primary_key` to `true` will change the default value of the `shown`
parameter to `false`. If you still want `shown` to be `true` — set it manually.

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    customer_id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
      shown: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: customer_id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
        shown: true
```

</CodeTabs>

If you don't have a single column in a cube's table that can act as a primary
key, you can create a composite primary key as shown below.

<InfoBox>

The example uses Postgres string concatenation; note that SQL may be different
depending on your database.

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id || '-' || ${CUBE}.signup_week || '-' || ${CUBE}.activity_week`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql:
          "{CUBE}.user_id || '-' || {CUBE}.signup_week || '-' ||
          {CUBE}.activity_week"
        type: string
        primary_key: true
```

</CodeTabs>

## CUBE reference

When you have several joined cubes, you should accurately use columns’ names to
avoid any mistakes. One way to make no mistakes is to use the `CUBE` reference.
It allows you to specify columns’ names in cubes without any ambiguity. During
the implementation of the query, this reference will be used as an alias for a
basic cube. Take a look at the following example:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    name: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: name
        sql: "{CUBE}.name"
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

## Transitive joins

<WarningBox>

Join graph is directed and `a → b` join is different from `b → a`. [Learn more
about it here][ref-schema-fundamentals-join-dir].

</WarningBox>

Cube automatically takes care of transitive joins. For example, consider the
following data model:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`a`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    b: {
      sql: `${a}.b_id = ${b.id}`,
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`b`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    c: {
      sql: `${b}.c_id = ${c.id}`,
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`c`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    category: {
      sql: `category`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: a
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: b
        sql: "{a}.b_id = {b.id}"
        relationship: many_to_one

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

  - name: b
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: c
        sql: "{b}.c_id = {c.id}"
        relationship: many_to_one

  - name: c
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: category
        sql: category
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

Assume that the following query is run:

```json
{
  "measures": ["a.count"],
  "dimensions": ["c.category"]
}
```

Joins `a → b` and `b → c` will be resolved automatically. Cube uses the
[Dijkstra algorithm][wiki-djikstra-alg] to find a join path between cubes given
requested members.
