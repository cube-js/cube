# Export and import

<InfoBox>

This functionality only works with data models written in JavaScript, not YAML.

</InfoBox>

In Cube, your data model is code, and code is much easier to manage when it is
in small, digestible chunks. It is best practice to keep files small and
containing only relevant and non-duplicated code. As your data model grows,
maintaining and debugging is much easier with a well-organized codebase.

Cube data models in JavaScript supports ES6-style [`export`][mdn-js-es6-export]
and [`import`][mdn-js-es6-import] statements, which allow writing code in one
file and sharing it, so it can be used by another file or files.

There are several typical use cases in Cube where it is considered best practice
to extract some variables or functions and then import it when needed.

## Managing constants

Quite often, you may want to have an array of test user IDs to exclude from your
analysis. You can define it once and `export` it like this:

```javascript
// in constants.js
export const TEST_USER_IDS = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Later, you can `import` into the cube whenever needed:

```javascript
// in Users.js
import { TEST_USER_IDS } from './constants';

cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    // ...
  },

  dimensions: {
    // ...
  },

  segments: {
    exclude_test_users: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.id NOT IN (${TEST_USER_IDS.join(', ')})`,
    },
  },
});
```

## Helper functions

You can assign some commonly used SQL snippets to JavaScript functions. The
example below shows a parsing helper function, which can be used across any
number of cubes to correctly parse a date if it was stored as a string.

You can read more about working with [string time dimensions
here][ref-schema-string-time-dims].

```javascript
// in helpers.js
export const parseDateWithTimeZone = (column) =>
  `PARSE_TIMESTAMP('%F %T %Ez', ${column})`;
```

```javascript
// in events.js
import { parseDateWithTimeZone } from './helpers';

cube(`events`, {
  sql_table: `events`,
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    date: {
      sql: `${parseDateWithTimeZone('date')}`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

## Import from parent directories

You may need to import from parent directories as Cube flattens nested
directories. The example below shows a correct way to import a helper function,
which is located in a parent directory.

```tree
.
├── README.md
├── cube.js
├── package.json
└── model
    ├── utils.js
    └── sales
        └── orders.js
```

```javascript
// in model/sales/orders.js
import { capitalize } from './schema_utils';
```

```javascript
// in model/utils.js
export const capitalize = (s) => s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1);
```

### Expose environment variables to data model files

A common use-case is to disable pre-aggregations unless running in "production"
or "staging" environments. The best approach is to add an environment variable
and make it available in data model files.

In the example below we have the following file structure:

```tree
.
├── README.md
├── cube.js
├── package.json
├── utils.js
└── model
    └── sales
        └── orders.js
```

In the `utils.js` file we read the environment variable and expose it. We will
default the environment variable to the value `dev`.

```javascript
// in utils.js
const environment =
  typeof process.env.ENVIRONMENT === 'undefined'
    ? 'dev'
    : process.env.ENVIRONMENT.toLowerCase();
exports.environment = () => environment;
```

In the data model file, the definition will change depending on the value of the
environment value.

```javascript
// in model/sales/orders.js
import { environment } from '../utils'
const isProdOrStaging = ["prod", "staging"].includes(environment())

cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: isProdOrStaging ? {
    main: {
      // ...
    }
  } : {}, // No pre-aggregations unless environment is prod or stagging
});
```
