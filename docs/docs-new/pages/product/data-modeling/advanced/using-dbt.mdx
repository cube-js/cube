# Using dbt

You can leverage Cube on top of dbt models by pointing cubes to dbt models in
your database.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
  - sql_table: my_dbt_schema.my_dbt_orders_model
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `my_dbt_schema.my_dbt_orders_model`,
});
```

</CodeTabs>

## Using dbt_metrics

<WarningBox>

Previously, Cube provided the `@cubejs-backend/dbt-schema-extension` package to
read metric definitions from dbt. Due to the [change in
direction][dbt-deprecation] at dbt, we have deprecated this package as well.
When a new `dbt_metrics` package becomes available, we will update and
reintroduce our integration.

</WarningBox>
