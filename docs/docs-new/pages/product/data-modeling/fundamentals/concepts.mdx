# Concepts

Cube borrows a lot of terminology from data science and [OLAP
theory][wiki-olap], and this document is intended for both newcomers and regular
users to refresh their understanding.

We'll use a sample e-commerce database with two tables, `orders` and
`line_items` to illustrate the concepts throughout this page:

**`orders`**

| **id** | **status** | **completed_at**           | **created_at**             |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1      | completed  | 2019-01-05 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 2      | shipped    | 2019-01-17 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 3      | completed  | 2019-01-27 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 4      | shipped    | 2019-01-09 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 5      | processing | 2019-01-29 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |

**`line_items`**

| **id** | **product_id** | **order_id** | **quantity** | **price** | **created_at**             |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | -------------------------- |
| 1      | 31             | 1            | 1            | 275       | 2019-01-31 00:00:00.000000 |
| 2      | 49             | 2            | 6            | 248       | 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 |
| 3      | 89             | 3            | 6            | 197       | 2021-11-25 00:00:00.000000 |
| 4      | 71             | 4            | 8            | 223       | 2019-12-23 00:00:00.000000 |
| 5      | 64             | 5            | 5            | 75        | 2019-04-20 00:00:00.000000 |

## Cubes

A cube represents a dataset in Cube, and is conceptually similar to a [view in
SQL][wiki-view-sql]. Cubes are typically declared in separate files with one
cube per file. Within each cube are definitions of [dimensions][self-dimensions]
and [measures][self-measures]. Typically, a cube points to a single table in
your database using the [`sql_table` property][ref-schema-ref-sql-table]:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders
```

</CodeTabs>

You can also use the [`sql` property][ref-schema-ref-sql] to accommodate more
complex SQL queries:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT *
    FROM orders, line_items
    WHERE orders.id = line_items.order_id
  `,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM orders, line_items WHERE orders.id = line_items.order_id
```

</CodeTabs>

## Views

Views sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They are useful for defining
metrics, managing governance and data access, and controlling ambiguous join
paths.

Views **can not** have their own members. Instead, use the `cubes` or `includes`
parameters to include measures and dimensions from other cubes into the view. In
the example below, we create a new view `active_users` which is made up of
properties from the `users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: base_orders,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `created_date`,
        `total_amount`,
        `total_amount_shipped`,
        `count`,
        `average_order_value`,
      ],
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.line_items.products,
      includes: [
        {
          name: `name`,
          alias: `product`,
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.users,
      prefix: true,
      includes: `*`,
      excludes: [`company`],
    },
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders

    cubes:
      - join_path: base_orders
        includes:
          - status
          - created_date
          - total_amount
          - total_amount_shipped
          - count
          - average_order_value

      - join_path: base_orders.line_items.products
        includes:
          - name: name
            alias: product

      - join_path: base_orders.users
        prefix: true
        includes: *
        excludes:
          - company

```

</CodeTabs>

## Dimensions

Dimensions represent the properties of a **single** data point in the cube.
[The `orders` table](#top) contains only dimensions, so representing them in the
`orders` cube is straightforward:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      // Here we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
      // This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
      primary_key: true,
    },

    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        # Here we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
        # This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
        primary_key: true

      - name: status
        sql: status
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

[The `line_items` table](#top) also has a couple of dimensions which can be
represented as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`line_items`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      // Again, we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
      // This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
      primary_key: true,
    },

    order_id: {
      sql: `order_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: line_items
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        # Again, we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
        # This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
        primary_key: true

      - name: order_id
        sql: order_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

Dimensions can be of different types, and you can find them all
[here][ref-schema-dimension-types].

Time-based properties should be represented as dimensions with type `time`. Time
dimensions allow grouping the result set by a unit of time (e.g. hours, days,
weeks). In analytics, this is also known as "granularity".

We can add the necessary time dimensions to both data models as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    created_at: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },

    completed_at: {
      sql: `completed_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: created_at
        sql: created_at
        type: time

      - name: completed_at
        sql: completed_at
        type: time
```

</CodeTabs>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`line_items`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    created_at: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: line_items
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: created_at
        sql: created_at
        type: time
```

</CodeTabs>

Time dimensions are essential to enabling performance boosts such as
[partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-use-preaggs-partition-time] and
[incremental refreshes][ref-tutorial-incremental-preagg].

## Measures

Measures represent the properties of a **set of data points** in the cube. To
add a measure called `count` to our `orders` cube, for example, we can do the
following:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
```

</CodeTabs>

In our `LineItems` cube, we can also create a measure to sum up the total value
of line items sold:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`line_items`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    total: {
      sql: `price`,
      type: `sum`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: line_items
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: total
        sql: price
        type: sum
```

</CodeTabs>

Measures can be of different types, and you can find them all
[here][ref-schema-measure-types].

## Joins

Joins define the relationships between cubes, which then allows accessing and
comparing properties from two or more cubes at the same time. In Cube, all joins
are `LEFT JOIN`s.

<InfoBox>

An `INNER JOIN` can be replicated with Cube; when making a Cube query, add a
filter for `IS NOT NULL` on the required column.

</InfoBox>

In the following example, we are left-joining the `line_items` cube onto our
`orders` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    line_items: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      // Here we use the `CUBE` global to refer to the current cube,
      // so the following is equivalent to `orders.id = line_items.order_id`
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${line_items.order_id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: line_items
        # Here we use the `CUBE` global to refer to the current cube,
        # so the following is equivalent to `orders.id = line_items.order_id`
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {line_items.order_id}"
        relationship: many_to_one
```

</CodeTabs>

There are the three [types of join relationships][ref-schema-ref-joins-types]:
`one_to_one`, `one_to_many`, and `many_to_one`.

## Segments

Segments are filters that are predefined in the data model instead of [a Cube
query][ref-backend-query-filters]. They allow simplifying Cube queries and make
it easy to re-use common filters across a variety of queries.

To add a segment which limits results to completed orders, we can do the
following:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  segments: {
    only_completed: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    segments:
      - name: only_completed
        sql: "{CUBE}.status = 'completed'"
```

</CodeTabs>

## Pre-aggregations

Pre-aggregations are a powerful way of caching frequently-used, expensive
queries and keeping the cache up-to-date on a periodic basis. Within a data
schema, they are defined under the `pre_aggregations` property:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - count
        dimensions:
          - status
        time_dimension: created_at
        granularity: day
```

</CodeTabs>
