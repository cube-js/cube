# Syntax

Entities within the data model (e.g., cubes, views, etc.) should be placed under
the `model` [folder][self-folder-structure], follow [naming
conventions][self-naming], and be defined using a supported
[syntax][self-syntax].

## Folder structure

Data model files should be placed inside the `model` folder. You can use the
[`schemaPath` configuration option][ref-config-model-path] to override the
folder name or the [`repositoryFactory` configuration
option][ref-config-repository-factory] to dynamically define the folder name and
data model file contents.

It's recommended to place each cube or view in a separate file, in `model/cubes`
and `model/views` folders, respectively. Example:

```tree
model
├── cubes
│   ├── orders.yml
│   ├── products.yml
│   └── users.yml
└── views
    └── revenue.yml
```

## Model syntax

Cube supports two ways to define data model files: with [YAML][wiki-yaml] or
JavaScript syntax.

<InfoBox>

YAML syntax is supported since v0.31.0.

</InfoBox>

YAML data model files should have the `.yml` extension, whereas JavaScript data
model files should end with `.js`.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT *
    FROM
      orders,
      line_items
    WHERE orders.id = line_items.order_id
  `,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM orders, line_items WHERE orders.id = line_items.order_id
```

</CodeTabs>

## Naming

Common rules apply to names of entities within the data model. All names must:

- start with a letter
- consist of letters, numbers, and underscore (`_`) symbols only

It is also recommended that names use [snake
case][wiki-snake-case].

Good examples of names:

- `orders`, `stripe_invoices`, or `base_payments` (cubes)
- `opportunities`, `cloud_accounts`, or `arr` (views)
- `count`, `avg_price`, or `total_amount_shipped` (measures)
- `name`, `is_shipped`, or `created_at` (dimensions)
- `main`, `orders_by_status`, or `lambda_invoices` (pre-aggregations)

## Scoping

Cubes have three types of members: measures, dimensions and segments. Members have full names and short names:
* Each member can be referenced either by its full name (`<cube_name>.<member_name>`) 
* or by its short name (`<member_name>`) __if member exists within the same cube__. 

There is also a handy `CUBE` context variable which
references the current cube. Important difference between same cube references
is `CUBE.<member-Name>` references are resolved runtime as opposed to compile
time `<member_name>` references.

Using the `CUBE` referencing causes its alias to be used in SQL queries. For
example, to avoid ambiguity in the `name` dimension in the following example, we
use the `CUBE` context variable to explicitly reference the `name` property from
the `users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  sql_table: `users`,

  joins: {
    contacts: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.contact_id = ${contacts.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_one`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    name: {
      sql: `COALESCE(${CUBE}.name, ${contacts.name})`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`contacts`, {
  sql_table: `contacts`,

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    name: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql_table: users

    joins:
      - name: contacts
        sql: "{CUBE}.contact_id = {contacts.id}"
        relationship: one_to_one

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "{CUBE}.id"
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: name
        sql: "COALESCE({CUBE.name}, {contacts.name})"
        type: string

  - name: contacts
    sql_table: contacts

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "{CUBE}.id"
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: name
        sql: "{CUBE}.name"
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

Referencing a foreign cube in the `sql` parameter instructs Cube to build an
implicit join to this cube. Using the data model above, we'll use a query as an
example:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["users.name"]
}
```

The resulting SQL output from [`/v1/sql`][ref-restapi-sql] would look like:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE("users".name, "contacts".name) "users__name"
FROM users "users"
LEFT JOIN contacts "contacts"
  ON "users".contact_id = "contacts".id
```


## SQL blocks

Cube requires you to provide SQL snippets in `sql` and `sql_table` parameters. 
The SQL code you provide in these parameters should match your database SQL dialect. 
Cube enables you to reference existing objects in SQL blocks with Python-like `{}` interpolation syntax in YAML models and `${}` interpolation operator in JS models.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `public.orders`,

  measures: {
    total_amount_shipped: {
      sql: `${CUBE.amount}`,
      type: `sum`,
      filters: [
        { sql: `${CUBE.status} = 'shipped'` }
      ]
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status`,
      type: `string`
    },

    amount: {
      sql: `${line_items.total_amount}`,
      type: `number`,
      sub_query: true
    }
  }
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: public.orders

    measures:
      - name: total_amount_shipped
        sql: "{CUBE.amount}"
        type: sum
        filters:
          - sql: "{CUBE.status} = 'shipped'"

    dimensions:
      - name: status
        sql: "{CUBE}.status"
        type: string

      - name: amount
        sql: "{line_items.total_amount}"
        type: number
        sub_query: true
```

</CodeTabs>

## Referring to objects

To write reusable data models, it is important to be able to reference existing objects, such as measures or dimensions.

In most cases you can just list objects as-is.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_status: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      measures: [CUBE.count],
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_status
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
```

</CodeTabs>


Inside [SQL blocks][self-sql-blocks] you need to use interpolation syntax, `{}` for YAML models and `${}` for JS models.



## Context Variables

Cube provides the following context variables you can access inside your data model

* __FILTER_PARAMS__: It helps to optimize SQL that powers Cube, e.g. hint your database optimizer to use a specific index 
or filter out partitions or shards in your cloud data warehouse so you won't be billed for scanning those.
* __SQL_UTILS__: Provides useful utils functions.
* __CUBE__: Handy helper to reference members via full names. Learn more about its usage in [scoping section][self-scoping].
* __COMPILE_CONTEXT__: it is being used to create dynamic data models. It is advanced concept and you can [read about it here][ref-dynamic-data-models]. 

You can find [Context variables reference here][ref-context-variables]
