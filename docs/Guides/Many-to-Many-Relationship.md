A many-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities, A and B, in which A may contain a parent instance for which there are many children in B and vice versa.

For example, we have Topics and Posts. A Post can cover many Topics, and a Topic could be covered by many Posts.

In a database, in this case, you most likely have an associative table (also known as a junction table or cross-reference table). In our example, this table would be `Post_Topic`.

The diagram below shows the tables `posts`, `topics`, `post_topics`, and their relationship.

In the same way the `Post_Topic` table was specifically created to handle this association in DB, we need to create an associative cube `Post_Topic`, and declare the relationships from it to parent cubes `Post` and `Topic`. Please note, we’re using the `hasMany` relationship on the `Post_Topic` cube. [Read more](direction-of-joins) about when to use `hasMany` vs `belongsTo`.

```javascript
cube(`Post_Topic`, {
  sql: `select * from post_topics`,

  joins: {
    Post: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${Post_Topic}.post_id = ${Post}.id`
    },

    Topic: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${Post_Topic}.topic_id = ${Topic}.id`
    }
  }
};
```

## Many-to-Many Relationship Without an Associative Table 
Sometimes there is no associative table in the database, when in reality, there is a many-to-many relationship. In this case, the solution is to extract some data from existing tables and create a virtual (not backed by a real table in the database) associative cube.

Let’s consider the following example. We have tables `Emails` and `Transactions`. The goal is to calculate the amount of transactions per campaign. Both `Emails` and `Transactions` have a `campaign_id` column. We don’t have a campaigns table, but data about campaigns is part of the `Emails` table.

Let’s take a look at the `Emails` cube first.


```javascript

cube(`Emails`, {
  sql: `select * emails`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true
    },

    campaignName: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`
    },

    campaignId: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `number`
    },
  }
});
```

We can extract campaigns data into a virtual `Campaigns` cube. 

```javascript

cube(`Campaigns`, {
  sql: `select campaign_id, campaign_name, customer_name, min(created_at) started_at from emails GROUP BY 1, 2, 3`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `string`,
      primaryKey: true
    },

    name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
});
```

The following diagram shows our data schema with the `Campaigns` cube.

The last piece is to finally declare a many-to-many relationship. This should be done by declaring a `hasMany` relationship on the associative cube, `Campaigns` in our case. 

```javascript

cube(`Campaigns`, {
  joins: {
    Emails: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${Emails}.campaign_id = ${Campaign}.campaign_id
      AND ${Emails}.customer_name = ${Campaign}.customer_name`
    },

    Transactions: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${Transactions}.customer_name = ${Campaign}.customer_name
      AND ${Transactions}.campaign_id = ${Campaign}.campaign_id`
    }
  }
});
```
