Cube.js provides a two-level caching system. The first level is **in-memory** cache and is active by default. In-memory cache
requires [Redis](https://redis.io) in [production mode](deployment).

To reset **in-memory** cache in development mode just restart the server.

The second in-database level is called **pre-aggregations** and requires explicit configuration to activate.

## In-memory Cache

Cube.js caches the results of executed queries using in-memory cache. The cache
key is generated SQL with any existing query dependent pre-aggregations.

Upon incoming request Cube.js first checks the cache using this key. If nothing
is found it executes the query in database, returns result back alongside writing to the cache.
If Cube.js detects existing cache entry for the key it schedules a background cache refresh check.


### Refresh Keys

Cube.js takes great care to prevent unnecessary queries from hitting your database. The first stage caching system that caches query results stores query results in Redis (or in the in memory store in development), but Cube.js needs a way to know if the data powering that query result has changed. If the data powering the result isn't any different, the cached result is valid and can be returned skipping that expensive query, but if the underlying data is different, the query needs to be re-run.

So, Cube.js defines a `refreshKey` for each cube. [refreshKeys](cube#parameters-refresh-key) can be evaluated by Cube.js to assess if cube data has changed.

__Note__: Cube.js *also caches* the results of `refreshKeys` for a fixed time interval in order to avoid issuing them too often. If you need Cube.js to immediately respond to changes in data, see the [Force Query Renewal](#force-query-renewal) section.

When a query's result needs to be refreshed, Cube.js will re-execute the query in the background and repopulate the cache. This means that cached results may still be served to users requesting them while this query is being re-run. The cache entry will be refreshed in the background if one of the two following conditions is met:

- Query cache entry is expired. The default expiration time is 6 hours.
- The result of the `refreshKey` SQL query is different from the previous one.

### Refresh Key Implementation

In order for Cube.js to properly expire cache entries and refresh in the background, Cube.js needs a value to track through time. There's a built in default `refreshKey` query strategy that works the following way:

1. Check the `max` of time dimensions with `updated` in the name, if none exist…
2. Check the `max` of any existing time dimension, if none exist…
3. Check the count of rows for this cube.

You can set up a custom refresh check SQL by changing [refreshKey](cube#parameters-refresh-key) property on the cube level though. There are situations where the default strategy doesn't work, like:

 - forecasting data or other timeseries data where the timestamps being queried are always the same or always purely dependent on the query
 - non-timeseries data like lists of customers or list of suppliers that doesn't have a time dimension
 - other data that may only get `UPDATE`s and few `INSERT`s, meaning the total row count doesn't change often.

In these instances, Cube.js needs a query crafted to detect updates to the rows that power the cubes. Often, a `MAX(updated_at_timestamp)` for OLTP data will accomplish this, or examining a metadata table for whatever system is managing the data to see when it last ran.

Note that the result of `refreshKey` query itself is cached for 2 minutes by default. You can change it by passing [refreshKeyRenewalThreshold](@cubejs-backend-server-core#cubejs-server-core-create-options-orchestrator-options) option when configuring Cube.js Server. This cache is useful so that Cube.js can build query result cache keys without issuing database queries and respond to cached requests very quickly.

### Force Query Renewal

If you need to force a specific query to load fresh data from the database (if it is available), e.g. some real time metrics, you can use the `renewQuery` option in the query. To use it add `renewQuery: true` to your Cube.js query as shown below:

```javascript
{
  measures: ['Orders.count'],
  dimensions: ['Orders.status'],
  renewQuery: true
}
```

The `renewQuery` option applies to the `refreshKey` caching system mentioned above, *not* the actual query result cache. If `renewQuery` is passed, Cube.js will always re-execute the `refreshKey` query, skipping that layer of caching, but, if the result of the `refreshKey` query is the same as the last time it ran, that indicates any current query result cache entries are valid, and they will be served. This means that cached data may still be served by Cube.js even if `renewQuery` is passed. This is a good thing: if the underlying data hasn't changed, the expensive query doesn't need to be re-run, and the database doesn't have to work as hard. This does mean that the `refreshKey` SQL must accurately report data freshness for the `renewQuery` to actually work and renew the query.

For situations like real-time analytics or responding to live user changes to underlying data, the `refreshKey` query cache can prevent fresh data from showing up immediately. For these situtations, you can mostly disable the `refreshKey` cache by setting the [refreshKeyRenewalThreshold](@cubejs-backend-server-core#cubejs-server-core-create-options-orchestrator-options) to something very low, like `1`. This means Cube.js will always check the data freshness before executing a query, and notice any changed data underneath.

## Pre-Aggregations

The **pre-aggregation** engine builds a layer of aggregated data in your database during the runtime and maintains it to be up-to-date.

Upon an incoming request, Cube.js will first look for a relevant pre-aggregation. If it cannot find any, it will build a new one. Once the pre-aggregation is built, all the subsequent requests will go to the pre-aggregated layer instead of hitting the raw data. It could speed the response time by hundreds or even thousands of times.

Pre-aggregations are materialized query results persisted as tables. In order to start using pre-aggregations, Cube.js should have write access to the `stb_pre_aggregations` schema where pre-aggregation tables will be stored.

Pre-aggregations are defined in the data schema. Below is an example of `rollup`
pre-aggregation. You can learn about defining pre-aggregations in [schema
reference.](pre-aggregations)


```javascript
preAggregations: {
  amountByCreated: {
    type: `rollup`,
    measureReferences: [amount],
    timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
    granularity: `month`
  }
}
```

### Refresh Strategy

Every two minutes on a new request Cube.js will initiate the refresh
check. Refresh strategy could be customized by setting the `refreshKey` property
for the pre-aggregation.

The default value of the `refreshKey` is `select date_trunc('hour', now())`. It means
that by default pre-aggregations would refresh **every hour**.

```javascript
preAggregations: {
  amountByCreated: {
    type: `rollup`,
    measureReferences: [amount],
    timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
    granularity: `month`,
    refreshKey: {
      sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`
    }
  }
}
```
