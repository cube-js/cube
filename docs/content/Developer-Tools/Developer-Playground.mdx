Developer Playground is a web-based tool which helps to generate and view the
data schema, build and execute queries, plot the results, and generate dashboard
applications from a variety of templates for different frontend frameworks and
data visualization libraries.

Developer Playground is available on `http://localhost:4000` when Cube.js is run
in [development mode][link-dev-mode].

Here's an example of building a query and plotting the results in Developer
Playground:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Playground Query and Results Example"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Developer-Tools/playground.gif"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Using query tabs

You can use query tabs to keep results of previous queries while still being
able to make new queries. The query tabs can be found at the top of the
Developer Playground:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube.js Developer Playground Tabs"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Developer-Tools/playground-tabs.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Editing the Security Context

The Security Context used for requests can be modified by clicking the Edit
Security Context button at the top of the playground:

<LoomVideo url="https://www.loom.com/embed/5307e973ad7e435094a31b7163f14f3d" />

You can paste in an existing JWT if desired; or create a brand-new one by
providing a JSON object that represents the decoded JWT.

## Running Playground in production

Developer playground is only enabled when `CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` is set to `true`.
Since Playground exposes data schema and admin access to all the possible
queries, we do not recommend running it on a production instance. You can use
[Cube.js frontend SDKs](/frontend-introduction) to build your own query builder
and use it to query your Cube.js API in a secure way.

You can also securely run Playground on top of the production Cube.js instance
inside [Cube Cloud][link-cube-cloud].

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>
