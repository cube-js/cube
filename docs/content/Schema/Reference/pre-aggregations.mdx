Pre-aggregations are materialized query results persisted as tables. Cube.js has
an ability to analyze queries against a defined set of pre-aggregation rules in
order to choose the optimal one that will be used to create pre-aggregation
table.

If Cube.js finds a suitable pre-aggregation rule, database querying becomes a
multi-stage process:

1. Cube.js checks if an up-to-date copy of the pre-aggregation exists.

2. Cube.js will execute a query against the pre-aggregated tables instead of the
   raw data.

Pre-aggregations can be defined in the `preAggregations` available on each cube.
A more in-depth diagram detailing how pre-aggregations are selected can be
[found here][ref-caching-preaggs-selecting-preaggs].

## Naming

Pre-aggregations must have, at minimum, a name and a type. This name, along with
the [name of the cube][ref-schema-cube-naming] will be used as a prefix for
pre-aggregation tables created in the database.

Pre-aggregation names should:

- Be unique within a cube
- Start with a lowercase letter
- Consist of numbers, letters and `_`

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    ordersByStatus: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      measures: [CUBE.count],
    },
  },
});
```

Pre-aggregations must include all dimensions, measures, and filters you will
query with.

## Parameters

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> type

Cube supports the following types of pre-aggregations:

- [`rollup`][self-rollup]
- [`originalSql`][self-originalsql]
- [`rollupJoin`][self-rollupjoin]
- [`rollupLambda`][self-rolluplambda]

The default type is `rollup`.

<h4 id="parameters-type-rollup">rollup</h4>

Rollup pre-aggregations are the most effective way to boost performance of any
analytical application. The blazing fast performance of tools like Google
Analytics or Mixpanel are backed by a similar concept. The theory behind it lies
in multi-dimensional analysis, and a rollup pre-aggregation is the result of a
[roll-up operation on an OLAP cube][wiki-olap-ops]. A rollup pre-aggregation is
essentially the summarized data of the original cube grouped by any selected
dimensions of interest.

The most performant kind of rollup pre-aggregation is an **additive** rollup:
all measures of which are based on [decomposable aggregate
functions][wiki-composable-agg-fn]. Additive measure types are: `count`, `sum`,
`min`, `max` or `countDistinctApprox`. The performance boost in this case is
based on two main properties of additive rollup pre-aggregations:

1. A rollup pre-aggregation table usually contains many fewer rows than its'
   corresponding original fact table. The fewer dimensions that are selected for
   roll-up means fewer rows in the materialized result. A smaller number of rows
   therefore means less time to query rollup pre-aggregation tables.

2. If your query is a subset of dimensions and measures of an additive rollup,
   then it can be used to calculate a query without accessing the raw data. The
   more dimensions and measures are selected for roll-up, the more queries can
   use this particular rollup.

Rollup definitions can contain members from a single cube as well as from
multiple cubes. In case of multiple cubes being involved, the join query will be
built according to the standard rules of cubes joining.

Rollups are selected for querying based on properties found in queries made to
the Cube.js REST API. A thorough explanation can be found under [Getting Started
with Pre-Aggregations][ref-caching-preaggs-target].

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    ordersByCompany: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
    },
  },
});
```

<h4 id="parameters-type-originalsql">originalSql</h4>

As the name suggests, it persists the results of the `sql` property of the cube.
Pre-aggregations of type `originalSql` should **only** be used when the cube's
`sql` is a complex query (i.e. nested, window functions and/or multiple joins).
We **strongly** recommend persisting results of `originalSql` only back to the
source database.

<WarningBox>

`originalSql` pre-aggregations **must only** be used when [storing
pre-aggregations in the source database][ref-caching-using-preaggs-internal].
While you can set `external: true` for `originalSql` pre-aggregation, this is
not recommended or generally supported.

</WarningBox>

They often do not provide much in the way of performance directly, but there are
two specific applications:

1. They can be used in tandem with the
   [`useOriginalSqlPreAggregations`][self-origsql-preaggs] option in other
   rollup pre-aggregations.

2. Situations where it is not possible to use a `rollup` pre-aggregations, such
   as [funnels][ref-recipe-funnels].

For example, to pre-aggregate all completed orders, you could do the following:

```javascript
cube(`CompletedOrders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE completed = true`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`
    },
  },
});
```

<h4 id="parameters-type-rollupjoin">rollupJoin</h4>

<WarningBox heading={`🐣  Preview`}>

`rollupJoin` is currently in Preview, and the API may change in a future
version.

</WarningBox>

Cube is capable of performing joins between pre-aggregations from different
[data sources][ref-schema-ref-cube-datasource] to avoid making excessive queries
to them.

<WarningBox>

Currently pre-aggregations of type `rollupJoin` do not support background
refreshing. Setting [`scheduledRefresh`](#parameters-scheduled-refresh) to
`true` will result in an error.

</WarningBox>

In the following example, we have a `Users` cube with a `usersRollup`
pre-aggregation, and an `Orders` cube with an `ordersRollup` pre-aggregation,
and an `ordersWithUsersRollup` pre-aggregation. Note the following:

- Both cubes have different values for `dataSource`.
- The type of `ordersWithUsersRollup` is `rollupJoin`.
- This pre-aggregation has a special property `rollups` which is an array
  containing references to both "source" rollups.

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
  dataSource: 'postgres',
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.users`,

  preAggregations: {
    usersRollup: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.id, CUBE.name],
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      // We need to set this field as the primary key for joins to work
      primaryKey: true,
    },
    name: {
      sql: `first_name || last_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube('Orders', {
  dataSource: 'mssql',
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    ordersRollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.userId, CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
    },
    // Here we add a new pre-aggregation of type `rollupJoin`
    ordersWithUsersRollup: {
      type: `rollupJoin`,
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [Users.name],
      rollups: [Users.usersRollup, CUBE.ordersRollup],
    },
  },

  joins: {
    Users: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      // Make sure the join uses dimensions on the cube, rather than
      // the column names from the underlying SQL
      sql: `${CUBE.userId} = ${Users.id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
    userId: {
      sql: `user_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`,
    },
    createdAt: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

<InfoBox>

`rollupJoin` is not required to join cubes from the same data source; instead
include the foreign cube's dimensions/measures in the rollup definition
directly:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    ordersRollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [Users.name, CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
    },
  },
});
```

</InfoBox>

<h4 id="parameters-type-rolluplambda">rollupLambda</h4>

<WarningBox>

`rollupLambda` pre-aggregations **must** be defined **before** any other
pre-aggregations in a cube.

</WarningBox>

A `rollupLambda` pre-aggregation is a special type of pre-aggregation that can
combine data from data sources and other rollups. It is extremely useful in
scenarios where real-time data is required.

[Lambda pre-aggregations][ref-caching-lambda-preaggs] can be used to combine
data from a data source and a pre-aggregation, or even from multiple
pre-aggregations across different schema-compatible cubes.

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> measures

The `measures` property is an array of [measures from the
cube][ref-schema-measures] that should be included in the pre-aggregation:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  preAggregations: {
    usersRollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> dimensions

The `dimensions` property is an array of [dimensions from the
cube][ref-schema-dimensions] that should be included in the pre-aggregation:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `status`,
    },
  },

  preAggregations: {
    usersRollup: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> timeDimension

The `timeDimension` property can be any [`dimension`][ref-schema-dimensions] of
type [`time`][ref-schema-types-dim-time]. All other measures and dimensions in
the schema are aggregated This property is an extremely useful tool for
improving performance with massive datasets.

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `status`,
    },
    createdAt: {
      type: `time`,
      sql: `created_at`,
    },
  },

  preAggregations: {
    ordersByStatus: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
    },
  },
});
```

A [`granularity`][self-granularity] **must** also be included in the
pre-aggregation definition.

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> granularity

The `granularity` property defines the granularity of data _within_ the
pre-aggregation. If set to `week`, for example, then Cube.js will pre-aggregate
the data by week and persist it to Cube Store.

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    usersRollupByWeek: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `week`,
    },
  },
});
```

The value can be one of `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`,
`quarter` or `year`. This property is required when using
[`timeDimension`][self-timedimension].

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> segments

The `segments` property is an array of [segments from the
cube][ref-schema-segments] that can target the pre-aggregation:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  segments: {
    onlyComplete: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`,
    },
  },

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      segments: [CUBE.onlyComplete],
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> partitionGranularity

The `partitionGranularity` defines the granularity for each
[partition][ref-caching-partitioning] of the pre-aggregation:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    usersRollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
    },
  },
});
```

The value can be one of `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`. A
[`timeDimension`][self-timedimension] and [`granularity`][self-granularity]
**must** also be included in the pre-aggregation definition. This property is
required when using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning].

Number of partitions to be built per cube is calculated as
[buildRange][self-buildrange] divided by `partitionGranularity`. Number of
partitions to be built per cube is multiplied by the count of time zones and
tenants in case different tenants have different pre-aggregation SQL.

<WarningBox>

Choose the count of partitions wisely as those consume memory and CPU resources.
As a rule of thumb, you do not want to go over 5,000-10,000 partitions in total
to keep the partitioning overhead low. Too many partitions will most likely
cause out of memory.

</WarningBox>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> refreshKey

Cube.js can also take care of keeping pre-aggregations up to date with the
`refreshKey` property. By default, it is set to `every: '1 hour'`.

<InfoBox>

When using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning], the refresh
key is evaluated for each partition separately.

</InfoBox>

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-sql">sql</h4>

You can set up a custom refresh check strategy by using the `sql` property:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refreshKey: {
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In the above example, the refresh key SQL will be executed every 10 seconds, as
[`every`][self-refreshkey-every] is not defined. If the results of the SQL
refresh key differ from the last execution, then the pre-aggregation will be
refreshed.

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-every">every</h4>

The `refreshKey` can define an `every` property which can be used to refresh
pre-aggregations based on a time interval. By default, it is set to `1 hour`
unless the [`sql` property][self-refreshkey-sql] is also defined, in which case
it is set to `10 seconds`. For example:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 day`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

For possible `every` parameter values please refer to
[`refreshKey`][ref-cube-refreshkey] documentation.

You can also use `every` with `sql`:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 hour`,
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In the above example, the refresh key SQL will be executed every hour. If the
results of the SQL refresh key differ from the last execution, then the
pre-aggregation will be refreshed.

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-incremental">incremental</h4>

You can incrementally refresh partitioned rollups by setting
`incremental: true`. This option defaults to `false`.

<WarningBox>

Partition tables are refreshed as a whole. When a new partition table is
available, it replaces the old one. Old partition tables are collected by a
garbage collection mechanism. Append is never used to add new rows to the
existing tables.

</WarningBox>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measure: [CUBE.count],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

<h4 id="parameters-refresh-key-updatewindow">updateWindow</h4>

<WarningBox>

Incremental refreshes without a defined `updateWindow` will only update the last
partition as determined by the pre-aggregation's `partitionGranularity`.

</WarningBox>

The `incremental: true` flag generates a special `refreshKey` SQL query which
triggers a refresh for partitions where the end date lies within the
`updateWindow` from the current time.

<WarningBox>

Because incremental refreshes generate their own SQL, you **must not** use the
[`sql`](#parameters-refresh-key-sql) property here.

</WarningBox>

In the example below, it will refresh today's and the last 7 days of partitions
once a day. Partitions before the `7 day` interval **will not** be refreshed
once they are built unless the rollup SQL is changed.

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measure: [CUBE.count],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
        updateWindow: `7 day`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This property is required when using [`incremental`][self-incremental]
refreshes.

### allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch

The `allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch` property can be used to allow queries to
match this pre-aggregation when using non-strict date ranges. This is useful
when using a visualization tools such as [Apache
Superset][ref-config-downstream-superset] that use loose date ranges by default.

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measure: [CUBE.count],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> useOriginalSqlPreAggregations

Cube.js supports multi-stage pre-aggregations by reusing original SQL
pre-aggregations in rollups through the `useOriginalSqlPreAggregations`
property. It is helpful in cases where you want to re-use a heavy SQL query
calculation in multiple `rollup` pre-aggregations. Without
`useOriginalSqlPreAggregations` enabled, Cube.js will always re-execute all
underlying SQL calculations every time it builds new rollup tables.

<WarningBox>

`originalSql` pre-aggregations **must only** be used when [storing
pre-aggregations in the source database][ref-caching-using-preaggs-internal].
This also means that `originalSql` pre-aggregations require `readOnly: false` to
be set on their respective database driver.

</WarningBox>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT * FROM orders1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM orders2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM orders3
    `,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`,
    },
    statuses: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      useOriginalSqlPreAggregations: true,
    },
    completedOrders: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      timeDimension: CUBE.completedAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      useOriginalSqlPreAggregations: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> scheduledRefresh

To always keep pre-aggregations up-to-date, you can set
`scheduledRefresh: true`. This option defaults to `true`. If set to `false`,
pre-aggregations will always be built on-demand. The
[`refreshKey`][self-refreshkey] is used to determine if there's a need to update
specific pre-aggregations on each scheduled refresh run. For partitioned
pre-aggregations, `min` and `max` dates for
[`timeDimension`][self-timedimension] are checked to determine range for the
refresh.

Each time a scheduled refresh is run, it takes every pre-aggregation partition
starting with most recent ones in time and checks if the
[`refreshKey`][self-refreshkey] has changed. If a change was detected, then that
partition will be refreshed.

In development mode, Cube.js runs the background refresh by default and will
refresh all pre-aggregations which have `scheduledRefresh: true`.

Please consult [Production Checklist][ref-production-checklist-refresh] for best
practices on running background refresh in production environments.

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    ordersByStatus: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> buildRangeStart and buildRangeEnd

The build range defines what partitions should be built by a scheduled refresh.
Data will **never** be queried beyond this range. By default, the build range is
defined as the minimum and maximum values possible for the
[`timeDimension`][self-timedimension] used in the rollup.

<InfoBox>

The SQL queries for the build range (as defined by the `sql` property) are
executed based on the [`refreshKey`][self-refreshkey] settings of the
pre-aggregation.

</InfoBox>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      buildRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW() - interval '300 day'`,
      },
      buildRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

It can be used together with the pre-aggregation's `refreshKey` to define
granular update settings. Set `refreshKey.updateWindow` to the interval in which
your data can change and `buildRangeStart` to the earliest point of time when
history should be available.

In the following example, `refreshKey.updateWindow` is `1 week` and
`buildRangeStart` is `SELECT NOW() - interval '365 day'`, so the scheduled
refresh will build historical partitions for 365 days in the past and will only
refresh last week's data.

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
      buildRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW() - interval '365 day'`,
      },
      buildRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
      refreshKey: {
        updateWindow: `1 week`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> unionWithSourceData

This option allows combining a pre-aggregation with fresh data retrieved from
the data source; this is extremely useful in scenarios where latency can be
sacrificed for accuracy.

To configure a pre-aggregation to behave in this way, ensure the pre-aggregation
is of type `rollupLambda`, and then set `unionWithSourceData` to `true`:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    ...,

    lambda: {
      type: `rollupLambda`,
      unionWithSourceData: true,
      rollups: [Orders.main]
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> indexes

In case of pre-aggregation tables having significant cardinality, you might want
to create indexes for them in databases which support it. This can be done as
follows:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.category],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        categoryIndex: {
          columns: [CUBE.category],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To maximize performance, you can introduce an index per query, so the set of
dimensions used in the query is the same as in the index. There's no need to
define measure columns in the index. The index column order is the sort order of
all data within the index. Under the hood, Cube Store will create table dataset
copy and will sort it according to index specification. Cube Store works best
when you define all your `equals` filter dimensions first and all dimensions
from `GROUP BY` last. For range filter columns like `contains`, `>`, `<`, `>=`,
`<=` with high selectivity, typically less than 5% of records keep those columns
before `GROUP BY` dimensions. Otherwise, for low selectivity range filters,
consider putting these columns after `GROUP BY` dimensions.

For `originalSql` pre-aggregations, the original column names as strings can be
used:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`,
      indexes: {
        timestampIndex: {
          columns: ['timestamp'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> Aggregating indexes

Cube Store also supports aggregating indexes that contain **only** specified
columns and pre-aggregated measures in the pre-aggregation definition.
[Queries][ref-api-ref-query-ref] that can target aggregating indexes must have
the following characteristics:

1. They cannot make use of any `filters` other than for those dimensions that
   are included in that index
2. **All** dimensions used in the query must be defined in the aggregating index

Queries that do not have the above can still make use of regular indexes so
performance can still be optimized.

Basically, the aggregating index is a rollup of data in a rollup table itself.
Data needs to be downloaded from the source DB as many times as many rollups you
have. Given that having a single rollup and multiple aggregate indexes gives you
pretty much the same performance from the Cube Store side but multiple times
less cost from a data warehouse perspective.

Aggregating indexes can be defined by adding a `type: 'aggregate'` to the index
definition:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        categoryIndex: {
          columns: [CUBE.status, Products.name],
        },
        aggregatedIndex: {
          columns: [CUBE.status],
          type: `aggregate`,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
