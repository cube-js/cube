A `cube` represents a table of data in Cube. Cubes are typically declared in
separate files with one cube per file. Within each cube are definitions of
measures, dimensions, and joins between cubes. A cube should always be declared
with a capital letter.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM users`,

  joins: {
    Organizations: {
      relationship: `belongs_to`,
      sql: `${Users.organization_id} = ${Organizations.id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
      sql: `id`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    organization_id: {
      sql: `organization_id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    created_at: {
      type: `time`,
      sql: `created_at`,
    },

    country: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `country`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Users
    sql: SELECT * FROM USERS
    joins:
      - name: Organizations
        relationship: belongs_to
        sql: "{CUBE.organization_id} = {Organizations.id}"
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        sql: id
    dimensions:
      - name: organization_id
        sql: organization_id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: created_at
        type: time
        sql: created_at
      - name: country
        type: string
        sql: country
```

</CodeTabs>

## Naming

There are certain rules to follow for a cube and cube member names:

- Be unique within the project
- Start with a letter
- Consist of numbers, letters and `_`

As a convention, cube names start with upper case letters and member names with
lower case letters. As in JavaScript, [camel case][wiki-camelcase] is used for
multi-word cube and member names.

## Members and Referencing

Cubes have three types of members: measures, dimensions and segments. Each
member can be referenced either by its fully-qualified name
(`<CubeName>.<memberName>`) or by its short version (`<memberName>`) if member
exists within the same cube. There is also a handy `CUBE` context variable which
references the current cube. Important difference between same cube references
is `CUBE.<memberName>` references are resolved runtime as opposed to compile
time `<memberName>` references.

Using the `CUBE` referencing causes its alias to be used in SQL queries. For
example, to avoid ambiguity in the `name` dimension in the following example, we
use the `CUBE` context variable to explicitly reference the `name` property from
the `Users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM users`,

  joins: {
    Contacts: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.contact_id = ${Contacts.id}`,
      relationship: `has_one`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    // primary key,

    name: {
      sql: `COALESCE(${CUBE}.name, ${Contacts.name})`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`Contacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM contacts`,

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
    name: {
      sql: `name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Users
    sql: SELECT * FROM USERS
    joins:
      - name: Contacts
        sql: "{CUBE.contact_id} = {Contacts.id}"
        relationship: has_one
    dimensions:
      - name: name
        sql: "COALESCE({CUBE.name}, {Contacts.name})"
        type: string

  - name: Contacts
    sql: SELECT * FROM contacts
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: name
        sql: name
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

Referencing a foreign cube in the `sql` parameter instructs Cube to build an
implicit join to this cube. Using the schema above, we'll use a query as an
example:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["Users.name"]
}
```

The resulting SQL output from [`/v1/sql`][ref-restapi-sql] would look like:

```sql
select COALESCE("users".name, "contacts".name) "users__name"
FROM users "users"
LEFT JOIN contacts "contacts" ON "users".contact_id = "contacts".id
```

## Abstract cubes

<WarningBox>

This feature is only available for Cube models authored in JavaScript.

</WarningBox>

Abstract cubes can be defined by simply omitting the first parameter to the
`cube()` function. Cubes defined in this way can still be extended, but will be
"hidden" from the [Developer Playground][ref-dev-playground] and calls to the
[`/meta` API endpoint][ref-restapi-meta].

```javascript
const Users = cube({
  sql: `select * from users`,

  dimensions: {
    // primary key,

    name: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`Contacts`, {
  extends: Users,
});
```

## Parameters

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> data_source

Each cube in schema can have its own `data_source` name to support scenarios
where data should be fetched from multiple databases. The value of the
`data_source` parameter will be passed to the
[`driverFactory()`][ref-config-driverfactory] function as part of the `context`
parameter. By default, each cube has a `default` value for its `data_source`; to
override it you can use:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`OrderFacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  data_source: `prod_db`,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: OrderFacts
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    data_source: prod_db
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> description

Use a description in your cubes to allow your team to better understand what
this cube is about. It is a very simple and yet useful tool that gives a hint to
everyone and makes sure data is interpreted correctly by users.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  title: `Product Orders`,
  description: `All orders related information`,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    title: Product Orders
    description: All orders related information
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> extends

You can extend cubes in order to reuse all declared members of a cube. In the
example below, `ExtendedOrderFacts` will reuse the `sql` and `count` measures
from `OrderFacts`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`OrderFacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
      sql: `id`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`ExtendedOrderFacts`, {
  extends: OrderFacts,

  measures: {
    double_count: {
      type: `number`,
      sql: `${count} * 2`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: OrderFacts
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        sql: id

  - name: ExtendedOrderFacts
    extends: OrderFacts
    measures:
      - name: double_count
        type: number
        sql: "{count} * 2"
```

</CodeTabs>

You can also omit the cube name while defining a cube in JavaScript. This way,
Cube doesn't register this cube globally; instead it returns a reference which
you can use while combining cubes. It makes sense to use it for dynamic schema
generation and reusing with `extends`. Previous example without defining
`OrderFacts` cube globally:

```javascript
const OrderFacts = cube({
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
      sql: `id`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`ExtendedOrderFacts`, {
  extends: OrderFacts,

  measures: {
    double_count: {
      type: `number`,
      sql: `${count} * 2`,
    },
  },
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> refresh_key

Cube's caching layer uses `refresh_key` queries to get the current version of
content for a specific cube. If a query result changes, Cube will invalidate all
queries that rely on that cube.

The default values for `refresh_key` are

- `every: '2 minute'` for BigQuery, Athena, Snowflake, and Presto.
- `every: '10 second'` for all other databases.

Refresh key of a query is a concatenation of all cubes refresh keys involved in
query. For rollup queries pre-aggregation table name is used as a refresh key.

You can set up a custom refresh check SQL by changing `refresh_key` property.
Often, a `MAX(updated_at_timestamp)` for OLTP data is a viable option, or
examining a metadata table for whatever system is managing the data to see when
it last ran. timestamp in that case.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`OrderFacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  // With this refresh_key Cube will only refresh the data if
  // the value of previous MAX(updated_at_timestamp) changed
  // By default Cube will check this refresh_key every 10 seconds
  refresh_key: {
    sql: `SELECT MAX(updated_at_timestamp) FROM orders`,
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: OrderFacts
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    refresh_key:
      sql: SELECT MAX(updated_at_timestamp) FROM orders
```

</CodeTabs>

You can use interval based `refresh_key`. For example:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`OrderFacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  refresh_key: {
    every: `1 hour`,
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: OrderFacts
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    refresh_key:
      every: 1 hour
```

</CodeTabs>

`every` - can be set as an interval with granularities `second`, `minute`,
`hour`, `day`, and `week` or accept CRON string with some limitations. If you
set `every` as CRON string, you can use the `timezone` property.

For example:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`OrderFacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,
  refresh_key: {
    every: '30 5 * * 5',
    timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: OrderFacts
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    refresh_key:
      every: 30 5 * * 5
      timezone: America/Los_Angeles
```

</CodeTabs>

`every` can accept only equal time intervals - so "Day of month" and "month"
intervals in CRON expressions are not supported.

<WarningBox>

Cube supports two different formats of CRON expressions: standard and advanced
with support for seconds.

</WarningBox>

Such `refresh_key` is just a syntactic sugar over `refresh_key` SQL. It's
guaranteed that `refresh_key` change its value at least once during `every`
interval. It will be converted to appropriate SQL select which value will change
over time based on interval value. Values of interval based `refresh_key` are
tried to be checked ten times within defined interval but not more than once per
`1 second` and not less than once per `5 minute`. For example if interval is
`10 minute` it's `refresh_key_renewal_threshold` will be 60 seconds and
generated `refresh_key` SQL (Postgres) would be:

```sql
SELECT FLOOR(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW()) / 600)
```

For `5 second` interval `refresh_key_renewal_threshold` will be just 1 second
and SQL will be:

```sql
SELECT FLOOR(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW()) / 5)
```

#### Supported cron formats

- Standard cron syntax

```
*    *    *    *    *
┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
│    │    │    │    |
│    │    │    │    └ day of week (0 - 7) (0 or 7 is Sun)
│    │    │    └───── month (1 - 12)
│    │    └────────── day of month (1 - 31, L)
│    └─────────────── hour (0 - 23)
└──────────────────── minute (0 - 59)
```

- Advanced cron format with support for seconds

```
*    *    *    *    *    *
┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
│    │    │    │    │    |
│    │    │    │    │    └ day of week (0 - 7) (0 or 7 is Sun)
│    │    │    │    └───── month (1 - 12)
│    │    │    └────────── day of month (1 - 31, L)
│    │    └─────────────── hour (0 - 23)
│    └──────────────────── minute (0 - 59)
└───────────────────────── second (0 - 59, optional)
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> rewrite_queries

Set this flag to true if you want Cube to rewrite your queries after final SQL
has been generated. This may be helpful to apply filter pushdown optimizations
or reduce unnecessary query nesting. For example:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Tickets`, {
  rewrite_queries: true,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Tickets
    rewrite_queries: true
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> shown

The `shown` property is used to manage the visibility of a cube. Valid values
for `shown` are `true` and `false`.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,
  shown: false,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    shown: false
```

</CodeTabs>

To learn more about using `shown` to control visibility based on security
context, read the [Controlling access to cubes and views
recipe][ref-recipe-control-access-cubes-views].

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> sql

The `sql` parameter specifies the SQL that will be used to generate a table that
will be queried by a cube. It can be any valid SQL query, but usually it takes
the form of a `select * from my_table` query. Please note that you don't need to
use `GROUP BY` in a SQL query on the cube level. This query should return a
plain table, without aggregations.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
```

</CodeTabs>

With JavaScript models, you can also reference other cubes' SQL statements for
code reuse:

```javascript
cube(`Companies`, {
  sql: `SELECT users.company_name, users.company_id FROM ${Users.sql()} AS users`,
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> sql_alias

Use `sql_alias` when auto-generated cube alias prefix is too long and truncated
by DB such as Postgres:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`OrderFacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  sql_alias: `ofacts`,

  // ...
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: OrderFacts
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    sql_alias: ofacts
```

</CodeTabs>

It'll generate aliases for members such as `ofacts__count`. `sql_alias` affects
all member names including pre-aggregation table names.

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> title

Use `title` to change the display name of the cube. By default, Cube will
humanize the cube's name, so for instance, `UsersOrder` would become
`Users Orders`. If default humanizing doesn't work in your case, please use the
title parameter. It is highly recommended to give human readable names to your
cubes. It will help everyone on a team better understand the data structure and
will help maintain a consistent set of definitions across an organization.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  title: `Product Orders`,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    title: Product Orders
```

</CodeTabs>

## Context Variables

### <--{"id" : "Context Variables"}--> Filter Params

`FILTER_PARAMS` allows you to use filter values during SQL generation. You can
add it for any valid SQL expression as in the case of dimensions. This is useful
if you want to hint your database optimizer to use a specific index or filter
out partitions or shards in your cloud data warehouse so you won't be billed for
scanning those.

It has the following structure:

```javascript
FILTER_PARAMS.<CUBE_NAME>.<FILTER_NAME>.filter(expression)
```

The `filter()` function accepts the expression, which could be either `String`
or `Function`. See the examples below.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`OrderFacts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE ${FILTER_PARAMS.OrderFacts.date.filter(
    'date'
  )}`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    date: {
      sql: `date`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: OrderFacts
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM orders WHERE {FILTER_PARAMS.OrderFacts.date.filter('date')}
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: date
        sql: date
        type: time
```

</CodeTabs>

This will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE date >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00' and date <= '2018-12-31 23:59:59'
```

for the `['2018-01-01', '2018-12-31']` date range passed for the
`OrderFacts.date` dimension as in following query:

```json
{
  "measures": ["OrderFacts.count"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "OrderFacts.date",
      "granularity": "day",
      "dateRange": ["2018-01-01", "2018-12-31"]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also pass a function instead of an SQL expression as a `filter()`
argument. This way you can add BigQuery sharding filtering for events, which
will reduce your billing cost.

> **NOTE:** When you're passing function to the `filter()` function, params are
> passed as string parameters from driver and it's your responsibility to handle
> type conversions in this case.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Events`, {
  sql: `
  SELECT * FROM schema.\`events*\`
  WHERE ${FILTER_PARAMS.Events.date.filter(
    (from, to) =>
      `_TABLE_SUFFIX >= FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y%m%d', TIMESTAMP(${from})) AND _TABLE_SUFFIX <= FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y%m%d', TIMESTAMP(${to}))`
  )}
  `,

  dimensions: {
    date: {
      sql: `date`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Events
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM schema.`events*`
      WHERE {FILTER_PARAMS.Events.date.filter(
        (from, to) =>
          `_TABLE_SUFFIX >= FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y%m%d', TIMESTAMP(${from})) AND _TABLE_SUFFIX <= FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y%m%d', TIMESTAMP(${to}))`
      )}
    dimensions:
      - name: date
        sql: date
        type: time
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Context Variables"}--> Security Context

`SECURITY_CONTEXT` is a user security object that is passed by the Cube Client.
Please read the [Security Context page][ref-sec-ctx] for more information on how
to set `SECURITY_CONTEXT`.

<InfoBox>

As a general rule, we **strongly** recommend using
[`queryRewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite] instead of `SECURITY_CONTEXT` wherever
possible.

</InfoBox>

Security context is suitable for the row level security implementation. For
example, if you have an `orders` table that contains an `email` field you can
restrict all queries to render results that belong only to the current user as
follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE ${SECURITY_CONTEXT.email.filter('email')}`,

  dimensions: {
    date: {
      sql: `date`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM orders
      WHERE {SECURITY_CONTEXT.email.filter('email')}
    dimensions:
      - name: date
        sql: date
        type: time
```

</CodeTabs>

To ensure filter value presents for all requests `requiredFilter` can be used:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE ${SECURITY_CONTEXT.email.requiredFilter(
    'email'
  )}`,

  dimensions: {
    date: {
      sql: `date`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM orders
      WHERE {SECURITY_CONTEXT.email.requiredFilter('email')}
    dimensions:
      - name: date
        sql: date
        type: time
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Context Variables"}--> Unsafe Value

<WarningBox>

Use of this feature entails SQL injection security risk. Use it with caution.

</WarningBox>

You can access values of context variables directly in javascript in order to
use it during your SQL generation. For example:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM ${
    SECURITY_CONTEXT.type.unsafeValue() === 'employee' ? 'employee' : 'public'
  }.orders`,

  dimensions: {
    date: {
      sql: `date`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM
      {SECURITY_CONTEXT.type.unsafeValue() === 'employee' ? 'employee' : 'public'}.orders
    dimensions:
      - name: date
        sql: date
        type: time
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Context Variables"}--> SQL Utils

#### convertTz

In case you need to convert your timestamp to user request timezone in cube or
member SQL you can use `SQL_UTILS.convertTz()` method. Note that Cube will
automatically convert timezones for `timeDimensions` fields in
[queries](/query-format#query-properties).

<WarningBox>

Dimensions that use `SQL_UTILS.convertTz()` should not be used as
`timeDimensions` in queries. Doing so will apply the conversion multiple times
and yield wrong results.

</WarningBox>

In case the same database field needs to be queried in `dimensions` and
`timeDimensions`, create dedicated dimensions in the cube definition for the
respective use:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`visitors`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    created_at_converted: {
      // do not use in timeDimensions query property
      type: 'time',
      sql: SQL_UTILS.convertTz(`created_at`),
    },
    created_at: {
      // use in timeDimensions query property
      type: 'time',
      sql: `created_at`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: visitors
    # ...
    dimensions:
      - name: createdAtConverted
        # do not use in timeDimensions query property
        type: time
        sql: "{SQL_UTILS.convertTz(`created_at`)}"
      - name: created_at
        # use in timeDimensions query property
        type: time
        sql: created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Context Variables"}--> Compile context

There's a global `COMPILE_CONTEXT` that captured as
[`RequestContext`][ref-config-req-ctx] at the time of schema compilation. It
contains `securityContext` and any other variables provided by
[`extendContext`][ref-config-ext-ctx].

<WarningBox>

While `securityContext` defined in `COMPILE_CONTEXT` it doesn't change it's
value for different users. It may change however for different tenants.

</WarningBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
const {
  securityContext: { deploymentId },
} = COMPILE_CONTEXT;

const schemaName = `user_${deploymentId}`;

cube(`Users`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM ${schemaName}.users`,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Users
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM
      {COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.deploymentId}
```
