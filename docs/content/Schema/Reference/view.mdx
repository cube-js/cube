Views sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They are useful for defining
metrics, managing governance and data access, and controlling ambiguous join
paths.

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Views **can not** have their own members. Instead, use the `includes` property
to include measures and dimensions from other cubes into the view. In the
example below, we create a new view `active_users` which is made up of properties
from the `users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,

  includes: [
    // Measure
    users.rolling_count,

    // Dimensions
    users.city,
    users.created_at,
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
    description: 14 days rolling count of active users

    includes:
      # Measures
      - users.rolling_count

      # Dimensions
      - users.city
      - users.created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

You also can reference measures and dimensions one-by-one. This is helpful when
there is a need to [control the join path][ref-schema-joins-direction] or to
rename measures and dimensions from the underlying cubes. In the example below,
we create a view `CompletedOrders` which brings in dimensions from the `Users`
cube through nested joins:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`completed_orders`, {
  description: `Count of completed orders`,

  includes: [
    orders.completed_count
  ],

  cubes: {
    // Setting an explicit join path to the included member.
    "orders.users": {
      includes: [
        {
          name: `city`,
          alias: `user_city`
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: completed_orders
    description: Count of completed orders

    includes:
      - orders.completed_count

    cubes:
      - name: orders.users

        includes:
          - name: city
            alias: user_city
```

</CodeTabs>

Views can be queried the same way as cubes; the example below show how to query
the above view with SQL API:

```sql
SELECT user_city, completed_count
FROM completed_orders
GROUP BY 1
```

Views also do not define any pre-aggregations, instead they re-use
pre-aggregations defined by the underlying cubes.

## Parameters

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> name

The `name` parameter serves as the identifier of a view. It must be unique among
_all cubes and views_ within a deployment and follow the [naming
conventions][ref-naming].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> description

A description of the view allows your team to better understand what its purpose
is. It is a very simple and yet useful tool that gives a hint to everyone and
ensures that data is interpreted correctly by users.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
    description: 14 days rolling count of active users
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> includes

The `includes` property is used to bulk add measures or dimensions to a view.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,

  includes: [
    // Measures
    users.rolling_count,

    // Dimensions
    users.city,
    users.created_at,
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users

    includes:
      # Measures
      - users.rolling_count

      # Dimensions
      - users.city
      - users.created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> public

<InfoBox>

Prior to v0.33, this property was called `shown`.

</InfoBox>

The `public` property is used to manage the visibility of a view. Valid values
for `public` are `true` and `false`. When set to `false`, this view **cannot**
be queried through the API. Defaults to `true`.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`arr`, {
  description: `Annual Recurring Revenue`,
  public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance,

  includes: [
    revenue.arr,
    revenue.date,
    customers.plan
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: arr
    description: Annual Recurring Revenue
    public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance

    includes:
      # Measures
      - revenue.arr
      # Dimensions
      - revenue.date
      - customers.plan
```

</CodeTabs>
