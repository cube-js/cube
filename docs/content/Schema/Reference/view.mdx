Views sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole data model with which data consumers can interact. 
They’re the place to define metrics, manage governance and data access, and control ambiguous join paths.

Views **can't** have their own members. You can use `includes` property to include measures and dimensions into view from cubes.

```js
view(`ActiveUsers`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
  includes: [
    // Measure
    Users.rollingCount, 
    // Dimensions
    Users.isPaying,
    Users.signupDate
  ]
});
```

You also can reference measures and dimensions one by one. It is helpful when you need to control join path, apply filter, or rename measures/dimensions. 

```js
view(`CompletedOrders`, {
  description: 'Count of completed orders',

  // You can use filters on measures to reduce views to the subset of the data
  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `${Orders.count}`,
      type: `number`
      filters: [
        { sql: `${Orders.status} = 'completed'` }
      ]
    }
  },

  // in the example below we are controlling join path
  // and rename dimensions
  dimensions: {
    orderWarehouseCountry: {
      sql: `${Orders.Countries.name}`,
      type: `string`
    },
    userCountry: {
      sql: `${Orders.Users.Countries.name}`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
});
```

Views can be queries the same way as cubes. Example below show how to query the above view with SQL API.

```sql
SELECT
  count,
  userCountry
FROM CompletedOrders
GROUP BY 2
```

## Parameters

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> description

Use a description in your cubes to allow your team to better understand what
this view is about. It is a very simple and yet useful tool that gives a hint to
everyone and makes sure data is interpreted correctly by users.

```js
view(`Active Users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> includes

`includes` property is used to bulk add measures or dimensions to view.

```js
view(`ActiveUsers`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
  includes: [
    // Measure
    Users.rollingCount, 
    // Dimensions
    Users.isPaying,
    Users.signupDate
  ]
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> shown

You can use `shown` property to manage visibility of the specific view.
Some data may be available only to specific roles within an organization or to specific customers.
In the example below, we’re making the `ARR` view only visible to users with finance permissions.


```js
view(`ARR`, {
  description: `Annual Recurring Recurring Revenue`,
  shown: COMPILE_CONTEXT.permissions['finance'],
  includes: [
    Revenue.arr,
    Revenue.date,
    Customers.plan
  ]
});
```
