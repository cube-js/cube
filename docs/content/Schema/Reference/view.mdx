Views sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They are useful for defining
metrics, managing governance and data access, and controlling ambiguous join
paths.

Views **can not** have their own members. Instead, use the `cubes` or `includes` parameters
to include measures and dimensions from other cubes into the view. In the
example below, we create a new view `active_users` which is made up of properties
from the `users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: base_orders,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `created_date`,
        `total_amount`,
        `total_amount_shipped`,
        `count`,
        `average_order_value`
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.line_items.products,
      includes: [
        {
          name: `name`,
          alias: `product`
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.users,
      prefix: true,
      includes: `*`,
      excludes: [
        `company`
      ]

    }
  ]
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders

    cubes:
      - join_path: base_orders
        includes:
          - status
          - created_date
          - total_amount
          - total_amount_shipped
          - count
          - average_order_value
      
      - join_path: base_orders.line_items.products
        includes: 
          - name: name
            alias: product

      - join_path: base_orders.users
        prefix: true
        includes: *
        excludes:
          - company

```

</CodeTabs>


Views can be queried the same way as cubes; the example below show how to query
the above view with SQL API:

```sql
SELECT 
  users_city,
  total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
```

Views also do not define any pre-aggregations, instead they re-use
pre-aggregations defined by the underlying cubes.

## Parameters

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> name

The `name` parameter serves as the identifier of a view. It must be unique among
_all cubes and views_ within a deployment and follow the [naming
conventions][ref-naming].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> description

A description of the view allows your team to better understand what its purpose
is. It is a very simple and yet useful tool that gives a hint to everyone and
ensures that data is interpreted correctly by users.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
    description: 14 days rolling count of active users
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> cubes

Use `cubes` parameter in view to include exposed cubes in bulk.
You can build your view by combining multiple joined cubes together and specifying the path by which they should be joined for that particular view. 

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: base_orders,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `created_date`,
        `total_amount`,
        `total_amount_shipped`,
        `count`,
        `average_order_value`
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.line_items.products,
      includes: [
        {
          name: `name`,
          alias: `product`
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.users,
      prefix: true
      includes: `*`,
      excludes: [
        `company`
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders

    cubes:
      - join_path: base_orders
        includes:
          - status
          - created_date
          - total_amount
          - total_amount_shipped
          - count
          - average_order_value
      
      - join_path: base_orders.line_items.products
        includes: 
          - name: name
            alias: product

      - join_path: base_orders.users
        prefix: true
        includes: *
        excludes:
          - company

```
</CodeTabs>

When listing cubes to expose, you need to provide a `join_path` parameter. It uses dot notation to describe the join path: `cube_1.cube_2.cube_3`.
For the root cube of the view, just put the cube name as in the example above for `base_orders`.

The other required parameter inside the `cubes` block is `includes`. You can simply list measures, dimensions, or segments you'd like to include.
In case you need to rename some of them, you can provide `name` and `alias` parameters.
Alternatively, you can use the `excludes` parameter in conjunction with the includes all definition `includes: *`.

Optionally, if you'd like to prefix exposed measures, dimensions, or segments with the cube name, you can use the `prefix: true` parameter.
It will prefix them with the cube name, e.g. `users_city`. You can use the `alias` parameter to rename the cube for the prefixing purpose.


### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> includes

The `includes` property is used to bulk add measures or dimensions to a view.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,

  includes: [
    // Measures
    users.rolling_count,

    // Dimensions
    users.city,
    users.created_at,
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users

    includes:
      # Measures
      - users.rolling_count

      # Dimensions
      - users.city
      - users.created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> public

<InfoBox>

Prior to v0.33, this property was called `shown`.

</InfoBox>

The `public` property is used to manage the visibility of a view. Valid values
for `public` are `true` and `false`. When set to `false`, this view **cannot**
be queried through the API. Defaults to `true`.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`arr`, {
  description: `Annual Recurring Revenue`,
  public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance,

  includes: [
    revenue.arr,
    revenue.date,
    customers.plan
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: arr
    description: Annual Recurring Revenue
    public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance

    includes:
      # Measures
      - revenue.arr
      # Dimensions
      - revenue.date
      - customers.plan
```

</CodeTabs>
