Views sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They’re the place to define
metrics, manage governance and data access, and control ambiguous join paths.

Views **can not** have their own members. Instead, use the `includes` property
to include measures and dimensions from other cubes into the view. In the
example below, we create a new view `ActiveUsers` which is made up of properties
from the `Users` cube:

```typescript
view(`ActiveUsers`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
  includes: [
    // Measure
    Users.rollingCount,
    // Dimensions
    Users.city,
    Users.createdAt,
  ],
});
```

You also can reference measures and dimensions one-by-one. This is helpful when
there is a need to control the join path, apply filters and/or rename
measures/dimensions. In the example below, we create a view `CompletedOrders`
which filters only completed orders from the `Orders` cube and also brings in
dimensions from the `Countries` and `Users` cubes through nested joins:

```typescript
view(`CompletedOrders`, {
  description: 'Count of completed orders',

  // You can use filters to reduce views to the subset of the data
  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `${Orders.status}`,
      type: `count`,
      filters: [{ sql: `${Orders.status} = 'completed'` }],
    },
  },

  // in the example below we are controlling join path
  // and rename dimensions
  dimensions: {
    userCity: {
      sql: `${Orders.Users.city}`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

Views can be queried the same way as cubes; the example below show how to query
the above view with SQL API.

```sql
SELECT
  count,
  userCountry
FROM CompletedOrders
GROUP BY 2
```

Views also do not define any pre-aggregations, instead they re-use
pre-aggregations defined by the underlying cubes.

## Parameters

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> description

A description of the view allows your team to better understand what its purpose
is. It is a very simple and yet useful tool that gives a hint to everyone and
ensures that data is interpreted correctly by users.

```typescript
view(`Active Users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> includes

The `includes` property is used to bulk add measures or dimensions to a view.

```typescript
view(`ActiveUsers`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
  includes: [
    // Measure
    Users.rollingCount,
    // Dimensions
    Users.city,
    Users.createdAt,
  ],
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> shown

The `shown` property is used to manage the visibility of a view. Some data may
be available only to specific roles within an organization or to specific
customers. In the example below, we’re making the `ARR` view only visible to
users with finance permissions:

```typescript
view(`ARR`, {
  description: `Annual Recurring Revenue`,
  shown: COMPILE_CONTEXT.permissions['finance'],
  includes: [Revenue.arr, Revenue.date, Customers.plan],
});
```
