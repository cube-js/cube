Views sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They are useful for defining
metrics, managing governance and data access, and controlling ambiguous join
paths.

</div>

Views **can not** have their own members. Instead, use the `includes` property
to include measures and dimensions from other cubes into the view. In the
example below, we create a new view `ActiveUsers` which is made up of properties
from the `Users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`ActiveUsers`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
  includes: [
    // Measure
    Users.rolling_count,
    // Dimensions
    Users.city,
    Users.created_at,
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: ActiveUsers
    description: 14 days rolling count of active users
    includes:
      # Measures
      - users.rolling_count
      # Dimensions
      - users.city
      - users.created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

You also can reference measures and dimensions one-by-one. This is helpful when
there is a need to [control the join path][ref-schema-joins-direction] or to
rename measures and dimensions from the underlying cubes. In the example below,
we create a view `CompletedOrders` which brings in dimensions from the `Users`
cube through nested joins:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`CompletedOrders`, {
  description: 'Count of completed orders',
  includes: [Orders.completed_count],

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `${Orders.completed_count}`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },

  // In the example below we are controlling the join path with a nested path
  // to the underlying member.
  dimensions: {
    userCity: {
      sql: `${Orders.Users.city}`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: CompletedOrders
    includes:
      # Measures
      - Orders.completed_count
      # Dimensions
      - Orders.Users.city
```

</CodeTabs>

Views can be queried the same way as cubes; the example below show how to query
the above view with SQL API:

```sql
SELECT
  count,
  userCountry
FROM CompletedOrders
GROUP BY 2
```

Views also do not define any pre-aggregations, instead they re-use
pre-aggregations defined by the underlying cubes.

## Parameters

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> description

A description of the view allows your team to better understand what its purpose
is. It is a very simple and yet useful tool that gives a hint to everyone and
ensures that data is interpreted correctly by users.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`ActiveUsers`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: ActiveUsers
    description: 14 days rolling count of active users
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> includes

The `includes` property is used to bulk add measures or dimensions to a view.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`ActiveUsers`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
  includes: [
    // Measure
    Users.rolling_count,
    // Dimensions
    Users.city,
    Users.created_at,
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: ActiveUsers
    includes:
      # Measures
      - users.rolling_count
      # Dimensions
      - users.city
      - users.created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Parameters"}--> shown

The `shown` property is used to manage the visibility of a view. Valid values
for `shown` are `true` and `false`.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`ARR`, {
  description: `Annual Recurring Revenue`,
  shown: true,
  includes: [Revenue.arr, Revenue.date, Customers.plan],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: ARR
    description: Annual Recurring Revenue
    shown: COMPILE_CONTEXT.permissions['finance'],
    includes:
      # Measures
      - Revenue.arr
      # Dimensions
      - Revenue.date
      - Customers.plan
```

</CodeTabs>
