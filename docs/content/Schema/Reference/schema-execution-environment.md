Cube.js Schema Compiler uses [Node.js VM][nodejs-vm] to execute schema compiler
code. It gives required flexibility allowing transpiling schema files before
they get executed, storing schemas in external databases and executing untrusted
code in a safe manner. Cube.js Schema JavaScript is standard JavaScript
supported by Node.js starting in version 8 with the following exceptions.

## Require

Being executed in VM data schema, JavaScript code doesn't have access to
[Node.js require][nodejs-require] directly. Instead `require()` is implemented
by Schema Compiler to provide access to other data schema files and to regular
Node.js modules. Besides that, the data schema `require()` can resolve Cube.js
packages such as `Funnels` unlike standard Node.js `require()`.

## Node.js globals (process.env, console.log and others)

Data schema JavaScript code doesn't have access to any standard Node.js globals
like `process` or `console`. In order to access `process.env`, utility functions
can be added outside the `schema/` directory:

**tablePrefix.js:**

```javascript
exports.tableSchema = () => process.env.TABLE_SCHEMA;
```

**schema/Users.js**:

```javascript
import { tableSchema } from '../tablePrefix';

cube(`Users`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM ${tableSchema()}.users`,

  // ...
});
```

## console.log

Data schema cannot access `console.log` due to a separate [VM
instance][nodejs-vm] that runs it. Suppose you find yourself writing complex
logic for SQL generation that depends on a lot of external input. In that case,
you probably want to introduce a helper service outside of `schema` directory
that you can debug as usual Node.js code.

## Cube.js globals (cube and others)

Cube.js defines `cube()`, `context()` and `asyncModule()` global variable
functions in order to provide API for schema configuration which aren't normally
accessible outside of Cube.js schema.

## Import / Export

Data schema JavaScript files are transpiled to convert ES6 `import` and `export`
expressions to corresponding Node.js calls. In fact `import` is routed to
[Require][self-require] method.

`export` can be used to define named exports as well as default ones:

**constants.js:**

```javascript
export const TEST_USER_IDS = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

**usersSql.js:**

```javascript
export default (usersTable) => `select * from ${usersTable}`;
```

Later, you can `import` into the cube, wherever needed:

**Users.js**:

```javascript
// in Users.js
import { TEST_USER_IDS } from './constants';
import usersSql from './usersSql';

cube(`Users`, {
  sql: usersSql(`users`),
  measures: {
    /* ... */
  },

  dimensions: {
    /* ... */
  },

  segments: {
    excludeTestUsers: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.id NOT IN (${TEST_USER_IDS.join(', ')})`,
    },
  },
});
```

## asyncModule

Schemas can be externally stored and retrieved through an asynchronous operation
using the `asyncModule()`. For more information, consult the [Dynamic Schema
Creation][ref-dynamic-schemas] page.

## Context symbols transpile

Cube.js uses a custom transpiler to optimize boilerplate code around referencing
cubes and cube members. There are reserved property names inside `cube`
definition that undergo reference resolve transpiling process:

- `sql`
- `measureReferences`
- `dimensionReferences`
- `segmentReferences`
- `timeDimensionReference`
- `drillMembers`
- `drillMemberReferences`
- `contextMembers`

Each of these properties inside `cube` and `context` definitions are transpiled
to functions with resolved arguments. For example:

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },

    ratio: {
      sql: `sum(${CUBE}.amount) / ${count}`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

is transpiled to:

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },

    ratio: {
      sql: (CUBE, count) => `sum(${CUBE}.amount) / ${count}`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

So for example if you want to pass the definition of `ratio` outside of the
cube, you would define it as:

```javascript
const measureRatioDefinition = {
  sql: (CUBE, count) => `sum(${CUBE}.amount) / ${count}`,
  type: `number`,
};

cube(`Users`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },

    ratio: measureRatioDefinition,
  },
});
