Cube.js supports the [`extends` feature][ref-schema-ref-cube-extends], which
allows you to reuse all declared members of a cube. This is a foundation for
building reusable data schemas.

[Cubes][self-schema-concepts-cubes] are represented as [JavaScript
objects][mdn-js-objects] with such properties as measures, dimensions, and
segments. Extending in Cube.js works similarly to JavaScript’s prototype
inheritance. Measures, dimensions, and segments are merged as separate objects.
So if the base cube defines measure `A` and the extending cube defines measure
`B`, the resulting cube will have both measures `A` and `B`.

The usual pattern is to **extract common measures, dimensions, and joins into
the base cube** and then **extend from the base cube**. This helps to prevent
code duplication and makes code easier to maintain and refactor.

In the example below, the `BaseEvents` cube defines the common events measures,
dimensions, and a join to the `Users` cube:

<InfoBox>

It’s important to use the `${CUBE}` reference instead of the `${BaseEvents}`
reference when referencing the extending cube. `${BaseEvents}` would not work in
this case, when the cube will be extended.

</InfoBox>

```javascript
cube(`BaseEvents`, {
  sql: `select * from events`,

  joins: {
    Users: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${Users}.id`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    timestamp: {
      sql: `time`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

The `ProductPurchases` and `PageViews` cubes are extended from `BaseEvents` and
define only the specific dimensions – `productName` for product purchases and
`pagePath` for page views.

```javascript
cube(`ProductPurchases`, {
  sql: `select * from product_purchases`,
  extends: BaseEvents,

  dimensions: {
    productName: {
      sql: `product_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`PageViews`, {
  sql: `select * from page_views`,
  extends: BaseEvents,

  dimensions: {
    pagePath: {
      sql: `page_path`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```
