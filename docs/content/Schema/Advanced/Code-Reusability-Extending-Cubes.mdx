Cube supports the [`extends` feature][ref-schema-ref-cube-extends], which allows
you to reuse all declared members of a cube. This is a foundation for building
reusable data schemas.

[Cubes][ref-schema-concepts-cubes] are represented as [JavaScript
objects][mdn-js-objects] with such properties as measures, dimensions, and
segments. Extending in Cube works similarly to JavaScript’s prototype
inheritance. Measures, dimensions, and segments are merged as separate objects.
So if the base cube defines measure `A` and the extending cube defines measure
`B`, the resulting cube will have both measures `A` and `B`.

The usual pattern is to **extract common measures, dimensions, and joins into
the base cube** and then **extend from the base cube**. This helps to prevent
code duplication and makes code easier to maintain and refactor.

In the example below, the `BaseEvents` cube defines the common events measures,
dimensions, and a join to the `Users` cube:

<InfoBox>

It’s important to use the `CUBE` reference when referencing properties on the
cube. Not specifying the cube name or using `${BaseEvents}` does not work when
the cube is extended.

</InfoBox>

```javascript
cube(`BaseEvents`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM events`,

  joins: {
    Users: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${Users.id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    timestamp: {
      sql: `time`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

The `ProductPurchases` and `PageViews` cubes are extended from `BaseEvents` and
define only the specific dimensions – `productName` for product purchases and
`pagePath` for page views.

```javascript
cube(`ProductPurchases`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM product_purchases`,
  extends: BaseEvents,

  dimensions: {
    productName: {
      sql: `product_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`PageViews`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM page_views`,
  extends: BaseEvents,

  dimensions: {
    pagePath: {
      sql: `page_path`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

## Usage with FILTER_PARAMS

If the base cube is using [`FILTER_PARAMS`][ref-schema-ref-cube-filter-params]
in any `sql` property, then extending cubes can do one of two things:

- Override the `sql` property in each target cube.
  ```javascript
  cube(`ProductPurchases`, {
    sql: `SELECT * FROM events WHERE 
           {$FILTER_PARAMS.ProductPurchases.timestamp.filter('time')}`,
  ...
  ```

- Put all filters inside the base cube and reference all specific cubes filters
  using `AND`. The unused filters will be rendered to `1 = 1` in the SQL query.
  ```javascript
  cube(`BaseEvents`, {
    sql: `SELECT * FROM events WHERE  
              {$FILTER_PARAMS.BaseEvents.timestamp.filter('time')}
          AND {$FILTER_PARAMS.ProductPurchases.timestamp.filter('time')}
          AND {$FILTER_PARAMS.PageViews.timestamp.filter('time')}`,
  ...
  ```
