You can leverage Cube on top of your dbt models by simply pointing to your model in your database.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
  - sql_table: my_dbt_schema.my_dbt_orders_model
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `my_dbt_schema.my_dbt_orders_model`
});
```

</CodeTabs>


## Using dbt metrics

Cube used the `@cubejs-backend/dbt-schema-extension` package to read metric definitions from dbt.

We have __deprecated__ that package due to a change in direction at dbt. 
When a new dbt metrics package becomes available, we will update and reintroduce our integration.
