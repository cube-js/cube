Funnels represent a series of events that lead users towards a defined goal. Funnel analysis is an approach commonly used in product, marketing and sales analytics.

Regardless of the domain, every funnel has the following traits:
* The identity of the object moving through the funnel â€“ e.g. user or lead
* A set of steps, through which the object moves
* The date and time of each step
* The time to convert between steps

Since funnels have a pretty standard structure, they are good candidates for being extracted into reusable packages. Cube.js comes pre-packaged with a standard funnel package.

```javascript
// First step is to require the Funnel package
const Funnels = require(`Funnels`);

cube(`PurchaseFunnel`, {
  extends: Funnels.eventFunnel({
    userId: {
      sql: `user_id`
    },
    time: {
      sql: `timestamp`
    },
    steps: [{
      name: `view_product`,
      eventsView: {
        sql: `select * from events where event = 'view_product'`
      }
    }, {
      name: `purchase_product`,
      eventsView: {
        sql: `select * from events where event = 'purchase_product'`
      },
      timeToConvert: '1 day'
    }]
  })
});
```
Cube.js will generate an SQL query for this funnel. Since funnel analysis in SQL is
not straight forward, the SQL code itself is quite complicated,
even for such a small funnel.

## Funnel parameters

### userId
A unique key to identify the users moving through the funnel.
```javascript
  userId: {
    sql: `user_id`
  }
```

### nextStepUserId
In the situation where `user_id` changes between steps, you can pass a unique key to join two adjacent steps.
For example, if a user signs in after having been tracked anonymously until that point in the funnel, you could use `nextStepUserId` to define a funnel where users are tracked by anonymous ID on the first step and then by an identified user ID on subsequent steps.
```javascript
const Funnels = require(`Funnels`);

cube(`OnboardingFunnel`, {
  extends: Funnels.eventFunnel({
    userId: {
      sql: `id`
    },
    time: {
      sql: `timestamp`
    },
    steps: [{
      name: `View Page`,
      eventsView: {
        sql: `select anonymous_id as id, timestamp from pages`
      }
    }, {
      name: `Sign Up`,
      eventsView: {
        sql: `select anonymous_id as id, user_id, timestamp from sign_ups`
      },
      nextStepUserId: {
        sql: `user_id`
      },
      timeToConvert: '1 day'
    }, {
      name: `Action`,
      eventsView: {
        sql: `select user_id as id from actions`
      },
      timeToConvert: '1 day'
    }]
  })
});
```

### time
A timestamp of the event.
```javascript
  time: {
    sql: `timestamp`
  }
```

### steps
An array of steps. Each step has 2 required and 1 optional parameters:
 * __name__ *(required)* - Name of the step. It must be unique within a funnel.
 * __eventsView__ *(required)* - Events table for the step. It must contain `userId` and `time` fields. For example, if we have defined the userId as `user_id` and time as `timestamp`, we need to have these fields in the table we're selecting from.
 * __timeToConvert__ *(optional)* - A time window during which conversion should happen. Set it depending on your funnel logic. If this is set to `1 day`, for instance, it means the funnel will include only users who made a purchase within 1 day of visiting the product page.

```javascript
  steps: [{
    name: `purchase_product`,
    eventsView: {
      sql: `select * from events where event = 'purchase_product'`
    },
    timeToConvert: '1 day'
  }]
```

## Joining funnels

In order to provide additional dimensions, funnels can be joined with other cubes using `user_id` at the first step of a funnel.
This will always use a `belongsTo` relationship, so hence you should always join with the corresponding user cube.
Here, by 'user' we understand this to be any entity that can go through a sequence of steps within funnel.
It could be a real web user with an auto assigned ID or a specific email sent by an email automation that goes through a typical flow of events like 'sent', 'opened', 'clicked', and so on.
For example, for our `PurchaseFunnel` we can add a join to another funnel as following:

```javascript
cube(`PurchaseFunnel`, {
  joins: {
    Users: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.first_step_user_id = ${Users}.id`
    }
  },

  extends: Funnels.eventFunnel({
    // ...
  })
});
```

## Using funnels

Cube.js is based on [multidimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_analysis) and operates on the measures and dimensions level. Thus, all funnel data is represented via a set of measures and dimensions.

Funnel-based cubes have the following structure:

### Measures
* __conversions__ - Count of conversions in the funnel. The most useful when
  broken down by __steps__. It's the classic funnel view.
* __conversionsPercent__ - Percentage of conversions. It is useful when you
  want to inspect a specific step, or set of steps, and find out how a conversion has changed over time.

### Dimensions
* __step__ - Describes funnels' steps. Use it to break down __conversions__ or
  __conversionsPercent__ by steps, or to filter for a specific step.
* __time__ - time dimension for the funnel. Use it to filter your analysis for
  specific dates or to analyze how conversion changes over time.

In the following example, we use the `conversions` measure along with the `steps` dimension
to display a classic bar chart showing the funnel's steps.

## Performance considerations

Funnel joins are extremely heavy for most modern databases and complexity grows in a non-linear way with the addition of steps.
It is best to use [partitioned rollups][ref-partitioned-rollups] to cache the steps instead. Add one to the `PurchaseFunnel` cube as follows:

```javascript
cube(`PurchaseFunnel`, {
  extends: Funnels.eventFunnel({
    // ...
  }),

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`,
    }
  }
});
```
