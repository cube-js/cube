[[info |]]
| To start building pre-aggregations, Cube.js requires write access to the
| [pre-aggregations schema][ref-config-preagg-schema] in the source database.
| Cube.js first builds pre-aggregations as tables in the source database and
| then exports them into the pre-aggregations storage.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Pre-aggregations are materialized query results persisted as tables. Cube.js has
an ability to analyze queries against a defined set of pre-aggregation rules in
order to choose the optimal one that will be used to create pre-aggregation
table.

If Cube.js finds a suitable pre-aggregation rule, database querying becomes a
multi-stage process:

1. Cube.js checks if an up-to-date copy of the pre-aggregation exists.

2. Cube.js will execute a query against the pre-aggregated tables instead of the
   raw data.

Pre-aggregations can be defined in the `preAggregations` available on each cube.

## Naming

Pre-aggregations must have, at minimum, a name and a type. This name, along with
the name of the cube will be used as a prefix for pre-aggregation tables created
in the database.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[[warning | ]]
| Some databases have trouble with long table names. You can work around this
| by specifying the [`sqlAlias`][ref-sqlalias] property on the cube and on
| the pre-aggregation definition.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Pre-aggregation names should:

- Be unique within a cube
- Start with a lowercase letter
- Consist of numbers, letters and `_`

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      sqlAlias: `original`,
      type: `originalSql`,
    },
  },
});
```

Pre-aggregations must include all dimensions, measures, and filters you will
query with.

## Rollup

Rollup pre-aggregations are the most effective way to boost performance of any
analytical application. The blazing fast performance of tools like Google
Analytics or Mixpanel are backed by a similar concept. The theory behind it lies
in multi-dimensional analysis and Rollup pre-aggregation is in fact the result
of [Roll-up Operation on a OLAP cube][wiki-olap-ops]. A rollup pre-aggregation
is essentially the summarized data of the original cube grouped by selected
dimensions of interest.

The most winning type of Rollup pre-aggregation is Additive Rollup: all measures
of which are based on [decomposable aggregate
functions][wiki-composable-agg-fn]. Additive measure types are: `count`, `sum`,
`min`, `max` or `countDistinctApprox`. The performance boost in this case is
based on two main properties of Additive Rollup pre-aggregations:

1. A rollup pre-aggregation table usually contains many fewer rows than its'
   corresponding original fact table. The fewer dimensions that are selected for
   roll-up means fewer rows in the materialized result. A smaller number of rows
   therefore means less time to query rollup pre-aggregation tables.

2. If your query is a subset of dimensions and measures of an additive rollup,
   then it can be used to calculate a query without accessing the raw data. The
   more dimensions and measures are selected for roll-up, the more queries can
   use this particular rollup.

Rollup definitions can contain members from a single cube as well as from
multiple cubes. In case of multiple cubes being involved, the join query will be
built according to the standard rules of cubes joining.

### Rollup selection rules

Rollup pre-aggregation defines a set of measures and dimensions used to
construct the query for pre-aggregation table. Each query issued against cube
where pre-aggregation is defined will be checked if specific rollup
pre-aggregation can be used by following algorithm:

1. Determine the type of the query as one of **Leaf Measure Additive** or **Not
   Additive**.

2. If query is **Leaf Measure Additive**, check if rollup contains all
   dimensions, filter dimensions and **Leaf Measures** are used in query and
   measures aren't multiplied.

3. If query is **Not Additive** check if query time dimension granularity is
   set, all query filter dimensions are included in query dimensions and that
   the rollup defines exact set of dimensions and all measures used in the
   query.

**Explanation of terms:**

- A query is **Leaf Measure Additive** if all of its **Leaf Measures** are
  either `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max` or `countDistinctApprox` type.

- A query is **Not Additive** if it's not **Additive** and not **Leaf Measure
  Additive**.

- **Leaf Measures** are measures that do not reference any other measures in
  their definition.

- Time dimension together with granularity constitute dimension. If the date
  range isn't aligned with granularity, a common granularity is used. To match
  granularity date range, its start date and end date should match. For example,
  for month it's `['2020-01-01T00:00:00.000', '2020-01-31T23:59:59.999']` and
  for day it's `['2020-01-01T00:00:00.000', '2020-01-01T23:59:59.999']`. Date
  ranges are inclusive. The minimum granularity is `second`.

- Multiplied measures are measures of cubes that define `hasMany` relations
  involved in pre-aggregation definition joins.

Also the order of pre-aggregation definitions in cubes matters. The first
matched pre-aggregation wins. Cubes of a measures and then cubes of dimensions
are checked to find a matching `rollup`. However `rollup` pre-aggregations
always have priority over `originalSql`. Thus, if you have both `originalSql`
and `rollup` defined, Cube.js will try to find matching `rollup` before trying
to find matching `originalSql`. Furthermore, you can instruct Cube.js to use
original sql pre-aggregations using
[`useOriginalSqlPreAggregations`][self-origsql-preaggs].

### Rollup examples

There are two types of definitions allowed for rollup pre-aggregation: with or
without time dimension.

Let's consider an example:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },

    revenue: {
      sql: `amount`,
      type: `sum`,
    },

    averageRevenue: {
      sql: `${revenue} / ${count}`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    category: {
      sql: `category`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    customerName: {
      sql: `customer_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    createdAt: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      type: `rollup`,
      external: true,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count, revenue],
      dimensionReferences: [category],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
    },
  },
});
```

Granularity can be either `hour`, `day`, `week` or `month`. If a
`timeDimensionReference` is set, `granularity` must also be specified.

In this particular example, these queries will use the `categoryAndDate`
pre-aggregation:

- Order Revenue by Category this month
- Order Count by Created At Day this year
- Order Count for all time
- Order Average Revenue by Category this month
- Order Revenue by Created At Week this year
- Order Revenue by Created At Month this year

These queries won't use `categoryAndDate` pre-aggregation:

- Order Count by Customer Name this year

### Time partitioning

Any `rollup` pre-aggregations can be partitioned by time using the
`partitionGranularity` property:

This can reduce rollup refreshing time and cost significantly. Partitioned
rollups currently cannot be used by queries without time dimensions.

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  //...

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      type: `rollup`,
      external: true,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count, revenue],
      dimensionReferences: [category],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
    },
  },
});
```

`partitionGranularity` can be either `day`, `week` or `month`. For example, if
the `partitionGranularity` is set to `month`, Cube.js will generate separate
`rollup` tables for each month.

### Segment Partitioning

Any rollup can be automatically filtered to particular segments by using the
`segmentReferences` property:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  segments: {
    toys: {
      sql: `category = 'toys'`,
    },
  },

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      type: `rollup`,
      external: true,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count, revenue],
      segmentReferences: [toys],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
    },
  },
});
```

## Original SQL

Original SQL pre-aggregation is the simplest type of pre-aggregation. As the
name suggests, it persists the results of the `sql` property of the cube.
Pre-aggregations of type `originalSql` should **only** be used when the cube's
`sql` is a complex query (i.e. nested, window functions and/or multiple joins).
We **strongly** recommend only persisting results of `originalSql` back to the
source database i.e. [set `internal: true`][ref-caching-using-preaggs-internal].
They often do not provide much in the way of performance directly, but there are
two specific applications:

1. They can be used in tandem with the
   [`useOriginalSqlPreAggregations`][self-origsql-preaggs] option in other
   rollup pre-aggregations.

2. Situations where it is not possible to use a `rollup` pre-aggregations, such
   as [funnels][ref-schema-funnels].

For example, to pre-aggregate all completed orders, you could do the following:

```javascript
cube(`CompletedOrders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders where completed = true`,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`,
      internal: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## rollupJoin

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[[warning | üê£ &nbsp;&nbsp; Preview]]
| `rollupJoin` is currently in Preview, and the API may change in a
| future version.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Cube.js is capable of performing joins between separate pre-aggregations,
thereby avoiding a call to the source database. This functionality also allows
for cross-database joins; you can have a data schema for a MySQL database,
another for Postgres, and then use `rollupJoin` to join their pre-aggregations:

```javascript
// A schema representing all companies, retrieved from MySQL
cube(`Companies`, {
  dataSource: 'mysql',
  sql: `SELECT * from ecom.companies`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    name: {
      sql: `name`,
      type: `string`,
      primaryKey: true,
      shown: true,
    },
  },

  preAggregations: {
    companiesRollup: {
      type: `rollup`,
      dimensionReferences: [Companies.name],
      external: true,
    },
  },
});

// A schema representing all users, retrieved from Postgres
cube('Users', {
  dataSource: 'postgres',
  sql: `select * from users`,
  joins: {
    Companies: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.company = ${Companies.name}`,
    },
  },
  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },
  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
    company: {
      sql: `company`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
  preAggregations: {
    usersRollup: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [Users.count],
      dimensionReferences: [Users.company],
      external: true,
    },
    // Here we add a new pre-aggregation of type `rollupJoin`
    joinedWithCompaniesRollup: {
      type: `rollupJoin`,
      measureReferences: [Users.count],
      dimensionReferences: [Companies.name],
      rollupReferences: [Companies.companiesRollup, Users.usersRollup],
      external: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## refreshKey

Cube.js can also take care of keeping pre-aggregations up to date with the
`refreshKey` property. By default, it is set to `every: '1 hour'`. You can set
up a custom refresh check strategy by using `refreshKey`:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count],
      refreshKey: {
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

As in the case of cube pre-aggregations, the `refreshKey` can define an `every`
property which can be used to refresh pre-aggregations based on a time interval.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[[warning | ]]
| The `every` parameter **does not** force Cube.js to fetch `refreshKey` based
| on an interval. It instead generates a SQL query whose result should change
| at least once per defined interval and adjusts `refreshKeyRenewalThreshold`
| accordingly. [Learn more][ref-cube-refreshkey].
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

For example:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 day`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

For possible `every` parameter values please refer to
[`refreshKey`][ref-cube-refreshkey] documentation.

## Incremental refresh

You can incrementally refresh partitioned rollups.

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReference: [count],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
        updateWindow: `7 day`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The `incremental: true` flag generates a special `refreshKey` SQL query which
triggers a refresh for partitions where the end date lies within the
`updateWindow` from the current time. In the provided example, it will refresh
today's and the last 7 days of partitions once a day. Partitions before the
`7 day` interval **will not** be refreshed once they are built unless the rollup
SQL is changed.

Partition tables are refreshed as a whole. When a new partition table is
available, it replaces the old one. Old partition tables are collected by
[Garbage Collection][ref-caching-garbage-collection]. Append is never used to
add new rows to the existing tables.

## useOriginalSqlPreAggregations

Cube.js supports multi-stage pre-aggregations by reusing original SQL
pre-aggregations in rollups through the `useOriginalSqlPreAggregations`
property. It is helpful in cases where you want to re-use a heavy SQL query
calculation in multiple `rollup` pre-aggregations. Without
`useOriginalSqlPreAggregations` enabled, Cube.js will always re-execute all
underlying SQL calculations every time it builds new rollup tables.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[[warning |]]
| `originalSql` pre-aggregations **must only** be used when [storing
| pre-aggregations on the source database][ref-caching-using-preaggs-internal].
| This also means that `originalSql` pre-aggregations require
| [`readOnly: false`][ref-caching-readonly].
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `
    select * from orders1
    UNION ALL
    select * from orders2
    UNION ALL
    select * from orders3
    `,

  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`,
    },
    category: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count, revenue],
      dimensionReferences: [category],
      useOriginalSqlPreAggregations: true,
    },
    date: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count],
      timeDimensionReference: date,
      granularity: `day`,
      useOriginalSqlPreAggregations: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## scheduledRefresh

To always keep pre-aggregations up-to-date, you can mark them as
`scheduledRefresh: true`. Without this flag, pre-aggregations are always built
on-demand. The `refreshKey` is used to determine if there's a need to update
specific pre-aggregations on each scheduled refresh run. For partitioned
pre-aggregations, `min` and `max` dates for `timeDimensionReference` are checked
to determine range for the refresh.

Each time a scheduled refresh is run, it takes every pre-aggregation partition
starting with most recent ones in time and checks if its `refreshKey` has
changed. If a change was detected, then that partition will be refreshed.

In development mode, Cube.js runs the background refresh by default and will
refresh all the pre-aggregations marked with `scheduledRefresh` parameter.

Please consult [Production Checklist][ref-production-checklist-refresh] for best
practices on running background refresh in production environments.

Example usage:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count, revenue],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
      scheduledRefresh: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## refreshRangeStart and refreshRangeEnd

The refresh range defines what partitions should be refreshed by a scheduled
refresh. Scheduled refreshes will never look beyond this range.

It can be used together with `updateWindow` to define granular update settings.
Set the `updateWindow` property to the interval in which your data can change
and `refreshRangeStart` to the earliest point of time when history should be
available. For example if `updateWindow` is `1 week` and `refreshRangeStart` is
`SELECT NOW() - interval '365 day'` scheduled refresh will build historic
partitions for 365 days in past and will refresh only one last week according to
the `refreshKey` setting.

The refresh range for partitioned pre-aggregations can be controlled using
`refreshRangeStart` and `refreshRangeEnd` properties:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count, revenue],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
      scheduledRefresh: true,
      refreshRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW() - interval '300 day'`,
      },
      refreshRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Indexes

In case of pre-aggregation tables having significant cardinality, you might want
to create indexes for them in databases which support it. This is can be done as
follows:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    categoryAndDate: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [Orders.count, revenue],
      dimensionReferences: [category],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        main: {
          columns: [category],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

For `originalSql` pre-aggregations, the original column names as strings can be
used:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `originalSql`,
      indexes: {
        time: {
          columns: ['timestamp'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
