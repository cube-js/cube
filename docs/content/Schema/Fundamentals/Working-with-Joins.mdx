A join creates a relationship between two cubes in your Cube project. Cube
supports three kinds of relationships often found in SQL databases:

- `hasOne`/`has_one`
- `hasMany`/`has_many`
- `belongsTo`/`belongs_to`

To use an example, let's use two cubes, `Customers` and `Orders`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Customers', {
  dimensions: {
    id: {
      primaryKey: true,
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
    company: {
      sql: `company`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube('Orders', {
  dimensions: {
    id: {
      primaryKey: true,
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    }
  }
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Customers
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: company
        sql: company
        type: string

  - name: Orders
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We could add a join to the `Customers` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Customers', {
  joins: {
    Orders: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${Orders.customer_id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Customers
    joins:
      - name: Orders
        relationship: has_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {Orders.customer_id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

The join above means a customer has many orders. Let's send the following JSON
query:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["Orders.status", "Customers.company"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Orders.created_at"
    }
  ],
  "order": [["Customers.company", "asc"]],
  "measures": ["Orders.count"]
}
```

The query above will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".status "orders__status",
  "customers".company "customers__company",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.customers AS "customers"
  LEFT JOIN public.orders AS "orders" ON "customers".id = "orders".customer_id
GROUP BY
  1,
  2
ORDER BY
  2 ASC
LIMIT
  10000
```

However, if we have guest checkouts, that would mean we would have orders with
no matching customer. Looking back at the `hasMany` relationship and its'
resulting SQL, any guest checkouts would be excluded from the results. To remedy
this, we'll remove the join from the `Customers` cube and instead define a join
with a `belongsTo` relationship on the `Orders` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  joins: {
    Customers: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_id = ${Customers.id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    joins:
      - name: Customers
        relationship: belongs_to
        sql: "{CUBE}.customer_id = {Customers.id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

In the above schema, our `Orders` cube defines the relationship between itself
and the `Customer` cube. The same JSON query now results in the following SQL
query:

```
SELECT
  "orders".status "orders__status",
  "customers".company "customers__company",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.orders AS "orders"
  LEFT JOIN public.customers AS "customers" ON "orders".customer_id = "customers".id
GROUP BY
  1,
  2
ORDER BY
  2 ASC
LIMIT
  10000
```

As we can see, the base table in the query is `orders`, and `customers` is in
the `LEFT JOIN` clause; this means any orders without a customer will also be
retrieved.

<InfoBox>

In Cube, joins only need to be defined from one direction. In the above example,
we explicitly _removed_ the `hasMany` relationship from the `Customer` cube; not
doing so would cause the query to fail as Cube would be unable to determine a
valid join path. [Click here][self-join-direction] to learn more about how the
direction of joins affects query results.

</InfoBox>

## Many-to-many joins

A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a cube are
associated with multiple records in another cube.

For example, let's say we have two cubes, `Topics` and `Posts`, pointing to the
`topics` and `posts` tables in our database respectively. A `Post` can have more
than one `Topic`, and a `Topic` may have more than one `Post`.

In a database, you would most likely have an associative table (also known as a
junction table or cross-reference table). In our example, this table name might
be `post_topics`.

<InfoBox>

You can [jump to this section][self-many-to-many-no-assoc-table] if you don't
have an associative table in your database.

</InfoBox>

The diagram below shows the tables `posts`, `topics`, `post_topics`, and their
relationships.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Many-to-Many Entity Diagram for posts, topics and post_topics"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Schema/Fundamentals/many-to-many-1.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

In the same way the `post_topics` table was specifically created to handle this
association in the database, we need to create an associative cube `PostTopics`,
and declare the relationships from it to `Topics` cube and from `Posts` to
`PostTopics`.

<InfoBox>

The following example uses the `hasMany` relationship on the `PostTopics` cube;
this causes the direction of joins to be `Posts -> PostTopics -> Topics`. [Read
more about direction of joins here][self-join-direction].

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Posts`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM posts`,

  joins: {
    PostTopics: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${PostTopics.post_id}`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`Topics`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM topics`,

  dimensions: {
    post_id: {
      sql: `id`,
      primaryKey: true,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`PostTopics`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM post_topics`,

  joins: {
    Topic: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.topic_id = ${Topics.id}`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    post_id: {
      sql: `post_id`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Posts
    sql: SELECT * FROM posts
    joins:
      - name: PostTopics
        relationship: belongs_to
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {PostTopics.post_id}"

  - name: Topics
    sql: SELECT * FROM topics
    dimensions:
      - name: post_id
        sql: id
        primary_key: true
        type: string

  - name: PostTopics
    sql: SELECT * FROM post_topics
    joins:
      - name: Topic
        relationship: has_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.topic_id = {Topics.id}"
    dimensions:
      - name: post_id
        sql: post_id
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

In scenarios where a table doesn't define a primary key, one can be generated
using SQL:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`PostTopics`, {
  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `CONCAT(${CUBE}.post_id, ${CUBE}.topic_id)`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: PostTopics
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "CONCAT({CUBE}.post_id, {CUBE}.topic_id)"
        type: number
        primary_key: true
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Many-to-many joins"}--> Many-to-many joins without an associative table

Sometimes there is no associative table in the database, when in reality, there
is a many-to-many relationship. In this case, the solution is to extract some
data from existing tables and create a virtual (not backed by a real table in
the database) associative cube.

Let’s consider the following example. We have tables `Emails` and
`Transactions`. The goal is to calculate the amount of transactions per
campaign. Both `Emails` and `Transactions` have a `campaign_id` column. We don’t
have a campaigns table, but data about campaigns is part of the `Emails` table.

Let’s take a look at the `Emails` cube first:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Emails`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM emails`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    campaign_name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    campaign_id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Emails
    sql: SELECT * FROM emails
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: campaign_name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string
      - name: campaign_id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We can extract campaigns data into a virtual `Campaigns` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Campaigns`, {
  sql: `
SELECT
  campaign_id,
  campaign_name,
  customer_name,
  MIN(created_at) AS started_at
FROM emails
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `string`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Campaigns
    sql: >
      SELECT
        campaign_id,
        campaign_name,
        customer_name,
        MIN(created_at) AS started_at
      FROM emails
      GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: string
        primary_key: true
      - name: name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

The following diagram shows our data schema with the `Campaigns` cube:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Many-to-Many Entity Diagram for emails, campaigns and transactions"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Schema/Fundamentals/many-to-many-2.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

The last piece is to finally declare a many-to-many relationship. This should be
done by declaring a [`hasMany` relationship][ref-schema-ref-joins-relationship]
on the associative cube, `Campaigns` in our case.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Emails`, {
  sql: `select * emails`,

  joins: {
    Campaigns: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.campaign_id = ${Campaigns.id}
      AND ${CUBE}.customer_name = ${Campaigns.customerName}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    campaign_name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    campaign_id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`Campaigns`, {
  joins: {
    Transactions: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_name = ${Transactions.customerName}
      AND ${CUBE}.campaign_id = ${Transactions.campaignId}`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    customer_name: {
      sql: `customer_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Emails
    sql: SELECT * FROM emails
    joins:
      - name: Campaigns
        relationship: belongs_to
        sql: "{CUBE}.campaign_id = {Campaigns.id} AND {CUBE}.customer_name = {Campaigns.customer_name}"
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: campaign_name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string
      - name: campaign_id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: number

  - name: Campaigns
    joins:
      - name: Transactions
        relationship: has_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.customer_name = {Transactions.customer_name} AND {CUBE}.campaign_id = {Transactions.campaign_id}"
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: customer_name
        sql: customer_name
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

## Directions of joins

The direction of [joins][ref-schema-ref-joins] greatly influences the final
result set. As an example, let's take two cubes, `Orders` and `Customers`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: 'id',
      type: 'count',
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
    customerId: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});

cube('Customers', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM customers`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: 'id',
      type: 'count',
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number

  - name: Customers
    sql: SELECT * FROM customers
    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
```


</CodeTabs>

The first case is to calculate the total revenue per customer. Let's name this
metric `total_revenue`. We also need to be aware of the fact that orders can be
placed without customer registration (anonymous customers/guest checkouts).
Because of anonymous customers, we should start the join from the `Orders` onto
the `Customers` cube so that we do not lose data from anonymous orders:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM orders`,

  joins: {
    Customers: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_id = ${Customers.id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: 'id',
      type: 'count',
    },

    total_revenue: {
      sql: 'revenue',
      type: 'sum',
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
      shown: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    joins:
      - name: Customers
        relationship: belongs_to
        sql: "{CUBE}.customer_id = {Customers.id}"
    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
      - name: total_revenue
        sql: revenue
        type: sum
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
        shown: true
      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

After adding the join to the schema, we can query the cube as follows:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["Users.company"],
  "measures": ["Orders.total_revenue"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Orders.created_at"
    }
  ]
}
```

The second case is to find customers without any orders. Let's call this metric
`count`. In this case we should join the `Customers` cube with the `Orders` cube
to find customers with 0 orders placed. The reverse order of joins would result
in a dataset without data for customers with no orders. Therefore, in this
instance, we declare the join in the `Customers` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Customers', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM customers`,

  joins: {
    Orders: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${Orders.customer_id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: 'id',
      type: 'count',
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
      shown: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Customers
    sql: SELECT * FROM customers
    joins:
      - name: Orders
        relationship: has_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {Orders.customer_id}"
    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
        shown: true
      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We can then query the cube as follows:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["Users.company"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Orders.created_at"
    }
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "member": "Orders.count",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": ["0"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### <--{"id" : "Directions of joins"}--> Using views

Views can also be used in Cube to represent the previous two scenarios:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view('TotalRevenuePerCustomer', {
  description: `Total revenue per customer`,

  includes: [Orders.total_revenue, Users.company],
});

view('CustomersWithoutOrders', {
  description: `Customers without orders`,

  includes: [Users.company],

  measures: {
    count: {
      // Note the nested path to Orders.count
      sql: `${Users.Orders.count}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: TotalRevenuePerCustomer
    description: Total revenue per customer
    includes:
      - Orders.total_revenue
      - Users.company

  - name: CustomersWithoutOrders
    description: Customers without orders
    includes:
      - Users.company
    measures:
      - name: count
        # Note the nested path to Orders.count
        sql: "{Users.Orders.count}"
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Directions of joins"}--> Transitive join pitfalls

Let's consider an example where we have a many-to-many relationship between
`Users` and `Organizations` through an `OrganizationUsers` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`OrganizationUsers`, {
  joins: {
    Users: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${Users.id}`,
      relationship: `hasMany`,
    },
    Organizations: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.organization_id = ${Organizations.id}`,
      relationship: `hasMany`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      // Joins require a primary key, so we'll create one on-the-fly
      sql: `CONCAT(${CUBE}.user_id, ':', ${CUBE}.organization_id)`,
      type: `string`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`Organizations`, {
  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
    name: {
      sql: `category`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Users
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

  - name: OrganizationUsers

Let's try and execute a query:

```json
{
  "measures": ["Users.count"],
  "dimensions": ["Organizations.name"]
}
```

You'll get an error:
`Error: Can't find join path to join 'Users', 'Organizations'`. The problem is
that joins are directed and if we try to connect `Users` and `Organizations`
there's no path from `Users` to `Organizations` or either from `Organizations`
to `Users`. One possible solution is to move the `Users-OrganizationUsers` join
from `OrganizationUsers` cube to `Users`, although this affects the query
semantics and thus the final results:

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
  joins: {
    OrganizationUsers: {
      sql: `${OrganizationUsers.user_id} = ${Users.id}`,
      relationship: `hasMany`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    type: `count`,
  },
});

cube(`OrganizationUsers`, {
  joins: {
    Organizations: {
      sql: `${OrganizationUsers.organization_id} = ${Organizations.id}`,
      relationship: `hasMany`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Users
    joins:
      - name: OrganizationUsers
        sql: "{OrganizationUsers.user_id} = {Users.id}"
        relationship: has_many
    measures:
      - name: type
        type: count

  - name: OrganizationUsers
    joins:
      - name: Organizations
        sql: "{OrganizationUsers.organization_id} = {Organizations.id}"
        relationship: has_many
```
