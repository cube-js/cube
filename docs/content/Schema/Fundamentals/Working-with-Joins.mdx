A join creates a relationship between two cubes in your Cube project. Cube
supports three [types of join relationships][ref-schema-ref-joins-relationship]
often found in SQL databases:

- `one_to_one`
- `one_to_many`
- `many_to_one`

To use an example, let's use two cubes, `customers` and `orders`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`customers`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    company: {
      sql: `company`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: company
        sql: company
        type: string

  - name: Orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We could add a join to the `customers` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`customers`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    orders: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${orders.customer_id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: orders
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {orders.customer_id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

The join above means a customer has many orders. Let's send the following JSON
query:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["orders.status", "customers.company"],
  "measures": ["orders.count"],
  "timeDimensions": [{
    "dimension": "orders.created_at"
  }],
  "order": {"customers.company": "asc"}
}
```

The query above will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".status "orders__status",
  "customers".company "customers__company",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.customers AS "customers"
  LEFT JOIN public.orders AS "orders"
    ON "customers".id = "orders".customer_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 ASC
LIMIT 10000
```

However, if we have guest checkouts, that would mean we would have orders with
no matching customer. Looking back at the `one_to_many` relationship and its'
resulting SQL, any guest checkouts would be excluded from the results. To remedy
this, we'll remove the join from the `customers` cube and instead define a join
with a `many_to_one` relationship on the `orders` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    customers: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_id = ${customers.id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: customers
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE}.customer_id = {customers.id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

In the above data model, our `orders` cube defines the relationship between
itself and the `customer` cube. The same JSON query now results in the following
SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".status "orders__status",
  "customers".company "customers__company",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.orders AS "orders"
  LEFT JOIN public.customers AS "customers"
    ON "orders".customer_id = "customers".id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 ASC
LIMIT 10000
```

As we can see, the base table in the query is `orders`, and `customers` is in
the `LEFT JOIN` clause; this means any orders without a customer will also be
retrieved.

<InfoBox>

In Cube, joins only need to be defined from one direction. In the above example,
we explicitly _removed_ the `one_to_many` relationship from the `customer` cube;
not doing so would cause the query to fail as Cube would be unable to determine
a valid join path. [Click here][self-join-direction] to learn more about how the
direction of joins affects query results.

</InfoBox>

## Many-to-many joins

A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a cube are
associated with multiple records in another cube.

For example, let's say we have two cubes, `topics` and `posts`, pointing to the
`topics` and `posts` tables in our database, respectively. A `post` can have more
than one `topic`, and a `topic` may have more than one `post`.

In a database, you would most likely have an associative table (also known as a
junction table or cross-reference table). In our example, this table name might
be `post_topics`.

<InfoBox>

You can [jump to this section][self-many-to-many-no-assoc-table] if you don't
have an associative table in your database.

</InfoBox>

The diagram below shows the tables `posts`, `topics`, `post_topics`, and their
relationships.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Many-to-Many Entity Diagram for posts, topics and post_topics"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Schema/Fundamentals/many-to-many-1.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

In the same way the `post_topics` table was specifically created to handle this
association in the database, we need to create an associative cube `post_topics`,
and declare the relationships from it to `topics` cube and from `posts` to
`post_topics`.

<InfoBox>

The following example uses the `one_to_many` relationship on the `post_topics`
cube; this causes the direction of joins to be `posts → post_topics → topics`.
[Read more about direction of joins here][self-join-direction].

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`posts`, {
  sql_table: `posts`,

  joins: {
    post_topics: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${post_topics.post_id}`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`topics`, {
  sql_table: `topics`,

  dimensions: {
    post_id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`post_topics`, {
  sql_table: `post_topics`,

  joins: {
    topic: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.topic_id = ${topics.id}`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    post_id: {
      sql: `post_id`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: posts
    sql_table: posts

    joins:
      - name: post_topics
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {post_topics.post_id}"

  - name: topics
    sql_table: topics

    dimensions:
      - name: post_id
        sql: id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

  - name: post_topics
    sql_table: post_topics

    joins:
      - name: topic
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.topic_id = {topics.id}"

    dimensions:
      - name: post_id
        sql: post_id
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

In scenarios where a table doesn't define a primary key, one can be generated
using SQL:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`post_topics`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `CONCAT(${CUBE}.post_id, ${CUBE}.topic_id)`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: post_topics
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "CONCAT({CUBE}.post_id, {CUBE}.topic_id)"
        type: number
        primary_key: true
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Many-to-many joins"}--> Many-to-many joins without an associative table

Sometimes there is no associative table in the database, when in reality, there
is a many-to-many relationship. In this case, the solution is to extract some
data from existing tables and create a virtual (not backed by a real table in
the database) associative cube.

Let’s consider the following example. We have tables `emails` and
`transactions`. The goal is to calculate the amount of transactions per
campaign. Both `emails` and `transactions` have a `campaign_id` column. We don’t
have a campaigns table, but data about campaigns is part of the `emails` table.

Let’s take a look at the `emails` cube first:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`emails`, {
  sql_table: `emails`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    campaign_name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    campaign_id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: emails
    sql_table: emails

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: campaign_name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string

      - name: campaign_id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We can extract campaigns data into a virtual `campaigns` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`campaigns`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT
      campaign_id,
      campaign_name,
      customer_name,
      MIN(created_at) AS started_at
    FROM emails
    GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
  `,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: campaigns
    sql: >
      SELECT
        campaign_id,
        campaign_name,
        customer_name,
        MIN(created_at) AS started_at
      FROM emails
      GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

      - name: name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

The following diagram shows our data model with the `Campaigns` cube:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Many-to-Many Entity Diagram for emails, campaigns and transactions"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Schema/Fundamentals/many-to-many-2.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

The last piece is to finally declare a many-to-many relationship. This should be
done by declaring a [`one_to_many`
relationship][ref-schema-ref-joins-relationship] on the associative cube,
`campaigns` in our case.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`emails`, {
  sql_table: `emails`,

  joins: {
    campaigns: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.campaign_id = ${campaigns.id}
      AND ${CUBE}.customer_name = ${campaigns.customer_name}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    campaign_name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    campaign_id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`campaigns`, {
  joins: {
    transactions: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_name = ${transactions.customer_name}
      AND ${CUBE}.campaign_id = ${transactions.campaign_id}`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    customer_name: {
      sql: `customer_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: emails
    sql_table: emails

    joins:
      - name: campaigns
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: >
          {CUBE}.campaign_id = {campaigns.id} AND
          {CUBE}.customer_name = {campaigns.customer_name}

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: campaign_name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string

      - name: campaign_id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: number

  - name: campaigns

    joins:
      - name: transactions
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: >
          {CUBE}.customer_name = {transactions.customer_name} AND
          {CUBE}.campaign_id = {transactions.campaign_id}
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: customer_name
        sql: customer_name
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

## Directions of joins

The direction of [joins][ref-schema-ref-joins] greatly influences the final
result set. As an example, let's take two cubes, `orders` and `customers`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`customers`, {
  sql_table: `customers`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
    
      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number

  - name: customers
    sql_table: customers

    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
```

</CodeTabs>

The first case is to calculate the total revenue per customer. Let's name this
metric `total_revenue`. We also need to be aware of the fact that orders can be
placed without customer registration (anonymous customers/guest checkouts).
Because of anonymous customers, we should start the join from the `orders` onto
the `customers` cube so that we do not lose data from anonymous orders:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  joins: {
    customers: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_id = ${customers.id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
    },

    total_revenue: {
      sql: `revenue`,
      type: `sum`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
      public: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    joins:
      - name: customers
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE}.customer_id = {customers.id}"

    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
      
      - name: total_revenue
        sql: revenue
        type: sum
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
        public: true

      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

After adding the join to the data model, we can query the cube as follows:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["users.company"],
  "measures": ["orders.total_revenue"],
  "timeDimensions": [{
    "dimension": "orders.created_at"
  }]
}
```

The second case is to find customers without any orders. Let's call this metric
`count`. In this case we should join the `customers` cube with the `orders` cube
to find customers with 0 orders placed. The reverse order of joins would result
in a dataset without data for customers with no orders. Therefore, in this
instance, we declare the join in the `customers` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`customers`, {
  sql_table: `customers`,

  joins: {
    orders: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${orders.customer_id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
      public: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    sql_table: customers

    joins:
      - name: orders
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {orders.customer_id}"

    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
        public: true

      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We can then query the cube as follows:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["users.company"],
  "timeDimensions": [{
    "dimension": "orders.created_at"
  }],
  "filters": [{
    "member": "orders.count",
    "operator": "equals",
    "values": ["0"]
  }]
}
```

### <--{"id" : "Directions of joins"}--> Using views

Views can also be used in Cube to represent the previous two scenarios:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`total_revenue_per_customer", {
  description: `Total revenue per customer`,

  includes: [
    orders.total_revenue,
    users.company
  ],
});

view(`customers_without_orders`, {
  description: `Customers without orders`,

  includes: [
    users.company,
    // Note the nested path to orders.count
    users.orders.count
  ]
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: total_revenue_per_customer
    description: Total revenue per customer

    includes:
      - orders.total_revenue
      - users.company

  - name: customers_without_orders
    description: Customers without orders

    includes:
      - users.company
      # Note the nested path to orders.count
      - users.orders.count
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Directions of joins"}--> Transitive join pitfalls

Let's consider an example where we have a many-to-many relationship between
`users` and `organizations` through an `organization_users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`organization_users`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    users: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${users.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
    },

    organizations: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.organization_id = ${organizations.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      // Joins require a primary key, so we'll create one on-the-fly
      sql: `CONCAT(${CUBE}.user_id, ':', ${CUBE}.organization_id)`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`organizations`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

Let's try and execute a query:

```json
{
  "measures": ["users.count"],
  "dimensions": ["organizations.name"]
}
```

You'll get an error:
`Error: Can't find join path to join 'users', 'organizations'`. The problem is
that joins are directed and if we try to connect `users` and `organizations`
there's no path from `users` to `organizations` or either from `organizations`
to `users`. One possible solution is to move the `users → organization_users` join
from `organization_users` cube to `users`, although this affects the query
semantics and thus the final results:

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    organization_users: {
      sql: `${organization_users.user_id} = ${users.id}`,

    },
  },

  measures: {
    type: `count`,
  },
});

cube(`organization_users`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    organizations: {
      sql: `${organization_users.organization_id} = ${organizations.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
