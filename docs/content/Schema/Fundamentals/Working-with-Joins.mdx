A join creates a relationship between two cubes in your Cube project. Cube
supports three [types of join relationships][ref-schema-ref-joins-relationship]
often found in SQL databases:

- `one_to_one`
- `one_to_many`
- `many_to_one`

To use an example, let's use two cubes, `customers` and `orders`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`customers`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    company: {
      sql: `company`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: company
        sql: company
        type: string

  - name: Orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We could add a join to the `customers` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`customers`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    orders: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${orders.customer_id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: customers
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: orders
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {orders.customer_id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

The join above means a customer has many orders. Let's send the following JSON
query:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["orders.status", "customers.company"],
  "measures": ["orders.count"],
  "timeDimensions": [{
    "dimension": "orders.created_at"
  }],
  "order": {"customers.company": "asc"}
}
```

The query above will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".status "orders__status",
  "customers".company "customers__company",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.customers AS "customers"
  LEFT JOIN public.orders AS "orders"
    ON "customers".id = "orders".customer_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 ASC
LIMIT 10000
```

However, if we have guest checkouts, that would mean we would have orders with
no matching customer. Looking back at the `one_to_many` relationship and its'
resulting SQL, any guest checkouts would be excluded from the results. To remedy
this, we'll remove the join from the `customers` cube and instead define a join
with a `many_to_one` relationship on the `orders` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    customers: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_id = ${customers.id}`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: customers
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE}.customer_id = {customers.id}"
```

</CodeTabs>

In the above data model, our `orders` cube defines the relationship between
itself and the `customer` cube. The same JSON query now results in the following
SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".status "orders__status",
  "customers".company "customers__company",
  count("orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM
  public.orders AS "orders"
  LEFT JOIN public.customers AS "customers"
    ON "orders".customer_id = "customers".id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 ASC
LIMIT 10000
```

As we can see, the base table in the query is `orders`, and `customers` is in
the `LEFT JOIN` clause; this means any orders without a customer will also be
retrieved.

<InfoBox>

In Cube, joins only need to be defined from one direction. In the above example,
we explicitly _removed_ the `one_to_many` relationship from the `customer` cube;
not doing so would cause the query to fail as Cube would be unable to determine
a valid join path. [Click here][self-join-direction] to learn more about how the
direction of joins affects query results.

</InfoBox>

## Many-to-many joins

A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a cube are
associated with multiple records in another cube.

For example, let's say we have two cubes, `topics` and `posts`, pointing to the
`topics` and `posts` tables in our database, respectively. A `post` can have more
than one `topic`, and a `topic` may have more than one `post`.

In a database, you would most likely have an associative table (also known as a
junction table or cross-reference table). In our example, this table name might
be `post_topics`.

<InfoBox>

You can [jump to this section][self-many-to-many-no-assoc-table] if you don't
have an associative table in your database.

</InfoBox>

The diagram below shows the tables `posts`, `topics`, `post_topics`, and their
relationships.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Many-to-Many Entity Diagram for posts, topics and post_topics"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Schema/Fundamentals/many-to-many-1.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

In the same way the `post_topics` table was specifically created to handle this
association in the database, we need to create an associative cube `post_topics`,
and declare the relationships from it to `topics` cube and from `posts` to
`post_topics`.

<InfoBox>

The following example uses the `one_to_many` relationship on the `post_topics`
cube; this causes the direction of joins to be `posts → post_topics → topics`.
[Read more about direction of joins here][self-join-direction].

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`posts`, {
  sql_table: `posts`,

  joins: {
    post_topics: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${post_topics.post_id}`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`topics`, {
  sql_table: `topics`,

  dimensions: {
    post_id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`post_topics`, {
  sql_table: `post_topics`,

  joins: {
    topic: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.topic_id = ${topics.id}`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    post_id: {
      sql: `post_id`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: posts
    sql_table: posts

    joins:
      - name: post_topics
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {post_topics.post_id}"

  - name: topics
    sql_table: topics

    dimensions:
      - name: post_id
        sql: id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

  - name: post_topics
    sql_table: post_topics

    joins:
      - name: topic
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{CUBE}.topic_id = {topics.id}"

    dimensions:
      - name: post_id
        sql: post_id
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

In scenarios where a table doesn't define a primary key, one can be generated
using SQL:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`post_topics`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `CONCAT(${CUBE}.post_id, ${CUBE}.topic_id)`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: post_topics
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "CONCAT({CUBE}.post_id, {CUBE}.topic_id)"
        type: number
        primary_key: true
```

</CodeTabs>

### <--{"id" : "Many-to-many joins"}--> Using virtual associative cube

Sometimes there is no associative table in the database, when in reality, there
is a many-to-many relationship. In this case, the solution is to extract some
data from existing tables and create a virtual (not backed by a real table in
the database) associative cube.

Let’s consider the following example. We have tables `emails` and
`transactions`. The goal is to calculate the amount of transactions per
campaign. Both `emails` and `transactions` have a `campaign_id` column. We don’t
have a campaigns table, but data about campaigns is part of the `emails` table.

Let’s take a look at the `emails` cube first:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`emails`, {
  sql_table: `emails`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    campaign_name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    campaign_id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: emails
    sql_table: emails

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: campaign_name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string

      - name: campaign_id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

We can extract campaigns data into a virtual `campaigns` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`campaigns`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT
      campaign_id,
      campaign_name,
      customer_name,
      MIN(created_at) AS started_at
    FROM emails
    GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
  `,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: campaigns
    sql: >
      SELECT
        campaign_id,
        campaign_name,
        customer_name,
        MIN(created_at) AS started_at
      FROM emails
      GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

      - name: name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

The following diagram shows our data model with the `Campaigns` cube:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Many-to-Many Entity Diagram for emails, campaigns and transactions"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Schema/Fundamentals/many-to-many-2.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

The last piece is to finally declare a many-to-many relationship. This should be
done by declaring a [`one_to_many`
relationship][ref-schema-ref-joins-relationship] on the associative cube,
`campaigns` in our case.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`emails`, {
  sql_table: `emails`,

  joins: {
    campaigns: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.campaign_id = ${campaigns.id}
      AND ${CUBE}.customer_name = ${campaigns.customer_name}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    campaign_name: {
      sql: `campaign_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    campaign_id: {
      sql: `campaign_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`campaigns`, {
  joins: {
    transactions: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.customer_name = ${transactions.customer_name}
      AND ${CUBE}.campaign_id = ${transactions.campaign_id}`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    customer_name: {
      sql: `customer_name`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: emails
    sql_table: emails

    joins:
      - name: campaigns
        relationship: many_to_one
        sql: >
          {CUBE}.campaign_id = {campaigns.id} AND
          {CUBE}.customer_name = {campaigns.customer_name}

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: campaign_name
        sql: campaign_name
        type: string

      - name: campaign_id
        sql: campaign_id
        type: number

  - name: campaigns

    joins:
      - name: transactions
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: >
          {CUBE}.customer_name = {transactions.customer_name} AND
          {CUBE}.campaign_id = {transactions.campaign_id}
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: customer_name
        sql: customer_name
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

## Directions of joins

The direction of [joins][ref-schema-ref-joins] greatly influences the final
result set. It can be explicitly controlled on a [view][ref-schema-ref-view] level.

As an example, let's take two cubes, `orders` and `customers`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    customer_id: {
      sql: `customer_id`,
      type: `number`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`customers`, {
  sql_table: `customers`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
    },

    total_revenue: {
      sql: `revenue`,
      type: `sum`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count

      - name: total_revenue
        sql: revenue
        type: sum
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
    
      - name: customer_id
        sql: customer_id
        type: number

  - name: customers
    sql_table: customers

    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true
```

</CodeTabs>

With the given data model, we have two valid analytics use cases that require different join directions.

__The first case is to calculate the total revenue per customer.__
To do this, we'll use the `total_revenue` measure that is defined on the orders cube. 
We need to be aware that orders can be placed without customer registration (anonymous customers/guest checkouts). 
Therefore, we should start the join from the `orders` cube onto the `customers` cube to ensure that we do not lose data from anonymous orders.


<CodeTabs>

```yaml
views:
  - name: total_revenue_per_customer
    description: Total revenue per customer

    cubes:
      - join_path: orders
        includes:
          - total_revenue
          - created_at

      - join_path: orders.customers
        includes:
          - company
```

```javascript
view(`total_revenue_per_customer`, {

});
```

</CodeTabs>


We can query this view as follows:



```json
{
  "dimensions": ["total_revenue_per_customer.company"],
  "measures": ["total_revenue_per_customer.total_revenue"],
  "timeDimensions": [{
    "dimension": "total_revenue_per_customer.created_at"
  }]
}
```


__The second case is to find customers who have not placed any orders.__
We will use the count measure on the customers cube for that. 
In this case, we should join the customers cube with the orders cube to find customers with zero orders placed.
The reverse order of joins would result in a dataset without data for customers with no orders.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
views:
  - name: customers_without_orders
    description: Customers without orders

    cubes:
      - join_path: customers
        includes: 
          - company

      - join_path: customers.orders
        prefix: true
        includes: 
          - created_at
          - count
```

```javascript
```
</CodeTabs>



We can then query the cube as follows:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["customers_without_orders.company"],
  "timeDimensions": [{
    "dimension": "customers_without_orders.orders_created_at"
  }],
  "filters": [{
    "member": "customers_without_orders.orders_count",
    "operator": "equals",
    "values": ["0"]
  }]
}
```

## Transitive join pitfalls

Let's consider an example where we have a many-to-many relationship between
`users` and `organizations` through an `organization_users` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`organization_users`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    users: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${users.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
    },

    organizations: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.organization_id = ${organizations.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      // Joins require a primary key, so we'll create one on-the-fly
      sql: `CONCAT(${CUBE}.user_id, ':', ${CUBE}.organization_id)`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },
  },
});

cube(`organizations`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    name: {
      sql: `category`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    # ...
    
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
    
    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

  - name: organization_users
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: users
        sql: "{CUBE}.user_id = {users.id}"
        relationship: one_to_many

      - name: organizations
        sql: "{CUBE}.organization_id = {organizations.id}"
        relationship: one_to_many

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        # Joins require a primary key, so we'll create one on-the-fly
        sql: "CONCAT({CUBE}.user_id, ':', {CUBE}.organization_id)"
        type: string
        primary_key: true

  - name: organizations
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

      - name: name
        sql: category
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

Let's try and execute a query:

```json
{
  "measures": ["users.count"],
  "dimensions": ["organizations.name"]
}
```

You'll get an error:
`Error: Can't find join path to join 'users', 'organizations'`. The problem is
that joins are directed and if we try to connect `users` and `organizations`
there's no path from `users` to `organizations` or either from `organizations`
to `users`. One possible solution is to move the `users → organization_users` join
from `organization_users` cube to `users`, although this affects the query
semantics and thus the final results:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    organization_users: {
      sql: `${organization_users.user_id} = ${users.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    type: `count`,
  },
});

cube(`organization_users`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    organizations: {
      sql: `${organization_users.organization_id} = ${organizations.id}`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Users
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: organization_users
        sql: "{organization_users.user_id} = {users.id}"
