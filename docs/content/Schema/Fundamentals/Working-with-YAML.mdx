## Ensure deployment is using latest Cube

First, ensure you're using Cube version `0.31.0` or higher. Then create a new
`.yml` file in the `schema/` folder.

## Syntax

The syntax for YAML modeling is very similar to the existing JavaScript syntax,
with a few key differences:

1. All schema properties can be written in either camel-case or snake-case i.e.
   `countDistinctApprox` can be written as `count_distinct_approx`,
   `preAggregations` can be written as `pre_aggregations` etc. We recommend
   using snake-case in YAML models.

2. References to cubes, views and context variables should be wrapped in `{}`
   i.e. `{FILTER_PARAMS.Orders.created_at.filter('created_at')}`.

3. String values only need to have quotes around them if they contain special
   values: `"{CUBE}.user_id = {Users.id}"`
