Cube supports two ways to define data models: with YAML or JavaScript syntax.

<InfoBox>

YAML syntax was introduced in Cube version `0.31.0`.

</InfoBox>

YAML data models are placed in `.yml` files in the `schema/` folder, whereas
JavaScript data models are placed in `.js` files in the same folder.

It's recommended to use YAML syntax by default; opt to JavaScript syntax when
you need to [dynamic data models](/schema/advanced/dynamic-schema-creation).

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      orders,
      line_items
    WHERE
      orders.id = line_items.order_id
  `,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM
        orders,
        line_items
      WHERE
        orders.id = line_items.order_id
```

</CodeTabs>

## Syntax comparison

YAML syntax is very similar to JavaScript syntax, with a few key differences:

1. In YAML syntax, data model properties can be written in either camel case or
   snake case, i.e., `countDistinctApprox` can be written as
   `count_distinct_approx`, `preAggregations` can be written as
   `pre_aggregations`, etc. It's recommended to use snake case in YAML models.

2. In YAML syntax, cubes, views, and context variables should be wrapped in
   `{}`, e.g., `{FILTER_PARAMS.Orders.created_at.filter('created_at')}`.

3. In YAML syntax, string values only need to have quotes around them if they
   contain special values, e.g., `"{CUBE}.user_id = {Users.id}"`.
