Entities within the data model (e.g., cubes, views, measures, dimensions, etc.)
should follow [naming conventions][self-naming] and be defined using a supported
[syntax][self-syntax].

## Naming

Common rules apply to names of entities within the data model. All names must:

- start with a letter
- consist of letters, numbers, and underscore (`_`) symbols only

It is also recommended that names use [snake
case][wiki-snake-case]<!-- and follow the style guide -->.

Good examples of names:

- `orders`, `stripe_invoices`, or `base_payments` (cubes)
- `opportunities`, `cloud_accounts`, or `arr` (views)
- `count`, `avg_price`, or `total_amount_shipped` (measures)
- `name`, `is_shipped`, or `created_at` (dimensions)
- `main`, `orders_by_status`, or `lambda_invoices` (pre-aggregations)

## Model syntax

Cube supports two ways to define data models: with [YAML][wiki-yaml] or
JavaScript syntax.

<InfoBox>

YAML syntax is supported since v0.31.0.

YAML data models are placed in `.yml` files in the `schema/` folder, whereas
JavaScript data models are placed in `.js` files in the same folder.

It's recommended to use YAML syntax by default; opt to JavaScript syntax when
you need to have a
[dynamic data model](/schema/advanced/dynamic-schema-creation).

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT * FROM
      orders,
      line_items
    WHERE
      orders.id = line_items.order_id
  `,
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM
        orders,
        line_items
      WHERE
        orders.id = line_items.order_id
```

</CodeTabs>

### Syntax comparison

YAML syntax is very similar to JavaScript syntax, with a few key differences:

- In YAML syntax, cubes, views, and context variables should be wrapped in `{}`,
  e.g., `{FILTER_PARAMS.Orders.created_at.filter('created_at')}`.
- In YAML syntax, string values only need to have quotes around them if they
  contain special values, e.g., `"{CUBE}.user_id = {Users.id}"`.
