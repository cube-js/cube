Cube manages security concerns through a combination of authentication and
authorization. Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity,
while authorization is the process of verifying what a user is allowed to
access.

## Authentication

### <--{"id" : "Authentication"}--> REST/GraphQL

Authentication in the REST and GraphQL APIs uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT). For
these APIs, the initial steps of authentication should be handled by the client
application, the client application should then send the JWT as the
`Authorization` header in all its' requests to Cube. Cube can then verify the
JWT using either `CUBEJS_API_SECRET`, or using JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) if
configured.

For more information on how to configure authentication for the REST and GraphQL
APIs, read the [Authentication & Authorization][ref-rest-graphql-sec] page.

### <--{"id" : "Authentication"}--> SQL

Authentication in the SQL API uses standard Postgres authentication with a
username and password. In Cube, the `checkSqlAuth()` configuration option is
used to verify an incoming username and password combination.

For more information on how to configure authentication for the SQL API, read
the [Authentication & Authorization][ref-sql-sec] page.

## Authorization

Cube has granular support for authorization, allowing access to be controlled at
the cube-, column- and/or row-level. This allows for flexible access control
that can be configured based on the needs of any downstream application.
