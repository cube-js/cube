In this step, we'll add a pre-aggregation to optimize the performance of a
specific query. Pre-aggregations are a caching technique that massively reduces
query time from seconds to milliseconds. They are extremely useful for speeding
up queries that are run frequently.

From the <Btn>Build</Btn> tab, execute a query:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Developer Playground Screen showing query results"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/899566a9-932b-46bc-8af0-2247b921ab64/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Just above the results, click on <Btn>Query was not accelerated with
pre-aggregation</Btn> to bring up the Rollup Designer:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Developer Playground Screen showing Rollup Designer"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/e5f8114a-c826-4d0a-84cc-7df33dff323f/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

The Rollup Designer will automatically suggest a pre-aggregation for the query;
click&nbsp;<Btn>Add to the Data Schema</Btn> and then retry the query in the
Playground. This time, the query should be accelerated with a pre-aggregation:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Developer Playground Screen querying a pre-aggregation"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/ff4312c2-e039-463b-8304-d57b4f69565f/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>
