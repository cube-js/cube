In this step, we'll add a pre-aggregation to optimize the performance of a
specific query. Pre-aggregations are a caching technique that massively reduces
query time from seconds to milliseconds. They are extremely useful for speeding
up queries that are run frequently.

From the <Btn>Build</Btn> tab, execute a query:

/>

Just above the results, click on <Btn>Query was not accelerated with
pre-aggregation</Btn> to bring up the Rollup Designer:

/>

The Rollup Designer will automatically suggest a pre-aggregation for the query;
click&nbsp;<Btn>Add to the Data Schema</Btn> and then retry the query in the
Playground. This time, the query should be accelerated with a pre-aggregation:
