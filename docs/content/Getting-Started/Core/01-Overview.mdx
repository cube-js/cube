To get started with Cube Cloud, first we'll create a new deployment, connect it
to a database and generate models from it. Then we'll query Cube using the
Developer Playground and APIs. Finally, we'll add a pre-aggregation to optimize
query latency down to milliseconds.

This guide will walk you through the following tasks:

- [Create a new project](/getting-started/core/create-a-project)
- [Generate models from a connected data source](/getting-started/core/generate-models)
- [Query Cube using the Developer Playground and APIs](/getting-started/core/query-data)
- [Add a pre-aggregation to optimize query performance](/getting-started/core/add-a-pre-aggregation)

If you'd prefer to try Cube Cloud, then you can refer to [Getting Started using
Cube Cloud][ref-getting-started-cloud-overview] instead.
