In this step, you will generate models using the connected data source from the
last step. Cube's models provide a declarative way to define important facts
about your data, relationships between them and access control.

## Select tables

Start by selecting the database tables to use to generate the models, then click
**Generate Schema**:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube's Generate Models Screen showing some tables selected from data source"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/40b148b5-6a3a-44dd-83e5-398dcb044ff5/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

After the models have been successfully generated, you should see the following
screen:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Screen showing successful generation of models"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/22ec5d36-052d-4435-858d-26bc8970a469/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Click **Build** to continue on the Playground, where you can explore the models
you just created. In the next step, we'll learn more about [how to query
