Now that you've set up your first project, learn more about what else Cube can
do for you.

## Access Control

Cube uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) to
[authenticate requests for the HTTP APIs](/security), and
[`checkSqlAuth()`](/config#check-sql-auth) to
[authenticate requests for the SQL API](/backend/sql/security).

Cube also supports using JWT claims for securing access to data, check out these
[related recipes on the topic](/recipes#recipes-access-control).

## Modeling

Learn more about [Cube's data model](/schema/fundamentals/concepts) and how to
effectively model your data for flexible and performant querying. For advanced
users, check out [related recipes](/recipes#recipes-data-schema) for tackling
specific modeling problems.

## Caching

Learn more about [Cube's two-level cache](/docs/caching), how
[pre-aggregations can help speed up queries](/caching/pre-aggregations/getting-started)
or for a deeper dive, take a look at the
[related recipes](/recipes#recipes-query-acceleration).

## Querying

Cube can be queried in a variety of ways. Learn how to query Cube using
[REST API](/rest-api), [GraphQL API](/backend/graphql), [SQL API](/backend/sql),
or how to [connect using one of our visualization tools](/config/downstream).
