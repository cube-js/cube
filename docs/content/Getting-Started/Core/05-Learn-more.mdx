## Data Modeling

Learn more about [data modeling](/schema/fundamentals/concepts) and how to
effectively define metrics in your data models. Advanced users: check out
[related recipes](/recipes#recipes-data-schema) for tackling specific data
modeling problems.

## Querying

Cube can be queried in a variety of ways. Explore how to use
[REST API](/rest-api), [GraphQL API](/backend/graphql), and
[SQL API](/backend/sql), or how to
[connect a BI or data visualization tool](/config/downstream).

## Caching

Learn more about the [two-level cache](/docs/caching) and how
[pre-aggregations help speed up queries](/caching/pre-aggregations/getting-started).
For a deeper dive, take a look at the
[related recipes](/recipes#recipes-query-acceleration).

## Access Control

Cube uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) to
[authenticate requests for the HTTP APIs](/security), and
[`checkSqlAuth()`](/config#check-sql-auth) to
[authenticate requests for the SQL API](/backend/sql/security). Cube also
supports using JWT claims for securing access to data, check out these
[related recipes](/recipes#recipes-access-control).
