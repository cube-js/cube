You can get started with Cube in one of two ways. The first is to use [Cube
Cloud][cube-cloud], our managed platform for Cube that includes features such as
collaboration for teams, a web-based IDE, automatic scaling and observability
features for instrumenting queries. Cube Cloud also comes with a free tier for
development projects and proof-of-concepts.

The second option is to run Cube on your own infrastructure.
