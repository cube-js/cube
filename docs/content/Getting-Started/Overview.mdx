You can get started with Cube in one of two ways.

We recommend using [Cube Cloud][cube-cloud], our managed platform for Cube,
because it's the easiest way to build, test, deploy, and manage Cube projects.
Cube Cloud includes features such as collaboration for teams, a web-based IDE,
auto-scaling, and observability. Cube Cloud also comes with a free tier for
development and proof-of-concept projects.

Alternatively, you can run Cube on your own infrastructure.
