You can get started with Cube locally or self-host it with Docker.

Alternatively, you can get started with [Cube Cloud](https://cube.dev/cloud/). It provides managed experience for Cube and has a free tier for development projects and proofs of concept.

There's also a legacy way to get started with [Node.js](getting-started/nodejs).
