Now that you've set up your first deployment, learn more about what else Cube
Cloud can do for you.

## Access Control

Cube Cloud enhances the existing security available in open-source and adds
[role-based access control](/cloud/access-control/) to secure the Cube Cloud UI
and individual deployments.

## Alerts and Observability

The [Queries](/cloud/inspecting-queries) page in Cube Cloud provides query-level
observability, allowing for easy diagnosis of performance issues and remedying
them with pre-aggregations where possible.

Cube Cloud also allows [setting up alerts](/cloud/workspace/alerts), so you can
be notified if something goes wrong with your deployment.

## Team collaboration

Cube Cloud allows you to invite other users to your account and manage their
access to your deployments. You can also create and manage multiple deployments,
each with their own set of users.

Cube Cloud has [a web-based IDE](/cloud/workspace/cube-ide) that can be used to
make changes to models and test them in a development environment. You can also
connect [Cube Cloud to Git](/cloud/deploys) to allow for easy collaboration.
