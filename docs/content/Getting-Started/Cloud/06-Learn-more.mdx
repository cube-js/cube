Now that you've set up your first deployment, learn more about other Cube Cloud
feaures.

## Access Control

Invite your team to collaborate in Cube Cloud and fine-tune their access to
deployments and features with
[role-based access control](/cloud/access-control/). You can create and manage
multiple deployments, each with their own set of users.

## Team collaboration

Cube Cloud has a [web-based IDE](/cloud/workspace/cube-ide) that can be used to
make changes to data models and test them in a development environment.

You can also connect [Cube Cloud to Git](/cloud/deploys) to sync and deploy from
your repository.

## Observability

The [Queries](/cloud/inspecting-queries) page in Cube Cloud provides query-level
observability, allowing to detect and remedy performance issues with
pre-aggregations where possible.

Cube Cloud also allows [setting up alerts](/cloud/workspace/alerts), so you can
be notified if something goes wrong with your deployment.
