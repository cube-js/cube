In this step, we'll add a pre-aggregation to optimize the performance of a
specific query. Pre-aggregations are a caching technique that massively reduces
query time from seconds to milliseconds, and are extremely useful for speeding
up queries that are run frequently.

From the Developer Playground, execute a query:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Developer Playground Screen showing query results"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/d2210bb7-a35e-4da7-ba29-447da24cc06d/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Just above the results, click on **Query was not accelerated with
pre-aggregation** to bring up the Rollup Designer:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Developer Playground Screen showing Rollup Designer"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/76c685b5-f778-486c-bf3f-e06996e29a50/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

The Rollup Designer will automatically suggest a pre-aggregation for the query;
simply click **Add to the Data Schema** and then retry the query in the
Playground. This time, the query should be accelerated with a pre-aggregation:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Developer Playground Screen querying a pre-aggregation"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/c0ded0ca-d2a7-45cc-b14a-9899ed3d9a5a/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>
