In this step, you will learn how to query your data using the data models you
created in the previous step. Cube Cloud provides several ways to query your
data, and we'll go over them here.

## Developer Playground

The Developer Playground is a web-based tool that allows you to query your data
without connecting any tools or writing any code. It's a fastest way to explore
your data.

Navigate to the <Btn>Playground</Btn> page in Cube Cloud:

/>

Next, you will select the measures and dimensions you want to query, and then
run the query. Let's do this for the `orders` cube you generated in the previous
step.

Click <Btn>+ Measure</Btn> to display the available measures and add
`orders.count`, then click <Btn>Run</Btn>:

/>

Next, click <Btn>+ Dimension</Btn> for available dimensions, add
`orders.status`, and then click <Btn>Run</Btn> again:

/>

Please feel free to experiment: select other measures or dimensions, pick a
granularity for the time dimension instead of&nbsp;<Btn>w/o grouping</Btn>, or
choose another chart type instead of&nbsp;<Btn>Table</Btn>.

## GraphQL API

From the deployment's Overview page, you can copy the GraphQL API URL for the
deployment:

/>

To see an example of how to query the GraphQL API using `curl`, click <Btn>How
to connect your application</Btn>:

/>

## REST API

To see an example of how to query the REST API using `curl`, click <Btn>How to
connect your application</Btn>:

/>

## SQL API

First, navigate to the <Btn>Settings</Btn> page and enable the SQL API.

Then, on the <Btn>Overview</Btn> page, click <Btn>How to connect</Btn>, which
will open instructions on connecting different tools to the SQL API. You should
see a screen with your connection credentials:

We can test it by running the provided `psql` command:

```bash{outputLines: 2-14}
PGPASSWORD=c9fba08a9b41f69f698b00134587d325 \
  psql -h fierce-bear.sql.aws-eu-central-1.cubecloudapp.dev \
  -p 5432 \
  -U cube fierce-bear

psql (14.5, server 14.2 (Cube SQL))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

fierce-bear=> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
 COUNT(UInt8(1))
-----------------
           10000
(1 row)
```

Since the SQL API is Postgres-compatible, please make sure to
select&nbsp;<Btn>Postgres</Btn> as the database type when [connecting from BI
tools][ref-downstream].

Now that we've seen how to use Cube's APIs, let's take a look at [how to add
pre-aggregations][next] to speed up your queries.
