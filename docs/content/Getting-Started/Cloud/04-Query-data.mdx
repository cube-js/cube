In this step, you will learn how to query your data using the models you created
in the previous step. Cube Cloud provides several ways to query your data, and
we'll go over them here.

## Developer Playground

The Playground is a web-based tool that allows you to query your data without
writing any code. It's a great way to get started with Cube and explore your
data.

To open the Playground, open the **Playground** page in Cube Cloud:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Developer Playground Screen"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/43394d9a-a309-46a1-952d-ccbce10078aa/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Next, you will select the measures and dimensions you want to query, and then
run the query. Let's do this for the `Orders` cube you generated in the previous
step.

Click **+ Measure** to display the available measures and add `Orders.count`,
then click **Run**:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Developer Playground Screen with a selected measure"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/2c13f612-cb29-4e44-8695-09d46d782240/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Next, click **+ Dimension** for available dimensions and add `Orders.status` and
then click **Run** again:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Developer Playground Screen with selected measures and dimensions"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/0ade1c53-df71-417b-88e6-3966341e33f3/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

## GraphQL API

From the deployment's Overview page, you can copy the GraphQL API URL for the
deployment:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Overview Screen"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/7fa603ae-6100-4492-91e4-564d311f701e/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

To see an example of how to query the GraphQL API using cURL, click **How to
connect your application**:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Screen with How to connect your application over GraphQL dialog open"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/4a153b5d-f746-451b-8c93-ab7891d98b47/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

## REST API

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Overview Screen"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/7fa603ae-6100-4492-91e4-564d311f701e/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

To see an example of how to query the REST API using cURL, click **How to
connect your application**:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Deployment Screen with How to connect your application over REST dialog open"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/30f90999-dd1b-495c-97c7-4656e61e65c1/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

## SQL API

On the Overview page, click **How to connect**, which will open a modal with
instructions on different ways to connect to the SQL API. Navigate to the SQL
API tab and enable the SQL API.

Once it is enabled, you should see a screen like the one below with your
connection credentials:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/1ae24899-ffb5-4e28-b4e3-2cdcc6871a09/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

We can test it by running the provided `psql` command:

```bash{outputLines: 2-14}
PGPASSWORD=c9fba08a9b41f69f698b00134587d325 \
  psql -h fierce-bear.sql.aws-eu-central-1.cubecloudapp.dev \
  -p 5432 \
  -U cube fierce-bear

psql (14.5, server 14.2 (Cube SQL))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

fierce-bear=> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders;
 COUNT(UInt8(1))
-----------------
           10000
(1 row)
```

Since the Cube SQL API is Postgres-compatible, please make sure to select
**Postgres** as the database type when connecting from BI tools.

Now that we've seen how to query Cube across its APIs, let's take a look at [how
to add pre-aggregations to your deployment to speed up your queries][next].
