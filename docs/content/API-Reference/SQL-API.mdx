<WarningBox heading={`🐣  Preview`}>

The Cube SQL API is currently in Preview, and there may be changes in a future
version.

</WarningBox>

Cube SQL API allows querying Cube via MySQL-compatible SQL. It enables the use
of BIs, Python Notebooks, Reverse ETLs, and other downstream tools on top of
Cube.

## Getting started

Check out the example of Cube connecting to Apache Superset:

<LoomVideo url="https://www.loom.com/embed/3e85b7fe3fef4c7bbb8b255ad3f2c675" />

To learn more about connecting to Apache Superset, check out [the
recipe][ref-recipe-cube-sql-superset].

### Cube Cloud

The first step to get started with SQL API in Cube Cloud is to create a
deployment. You can follow this
[step-by-step guide on creating deployment within Cube Cloud](/cloud/getting-started/create).

Once the deployment is ready click **How to connect** link on the Overview page.
It will open the modal with instructions on different ways to connect to Cube,
navigate to the SQL API tab and enable the SQL API.

Once it is enabled you should see the screen like the one below with your
connection credentials.

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Since Cube SQL API is MySQL-compatible, please make sure to select **MySQL** as
a database type when connecting from BI tools.

### Self-hosted Cube

To enable the SQL API, we first need to add a new environment variable:

```dotenv
CUBEJS_SQL_PORT=3306
```

If you're running Cube with Docker, remember to add a port mapping to the Cube
service for `CUBEJS_SQL_PORT`. Docker compose example:

```yaml
services:
  cube_api:
    ...
    ports:
      - 3306:3306 # Cube SQL API
```

Then, set Cube SQL credentials auth:

```
CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

Now, you can start your Cube instance and connect via the `mysql` client with
provided credentials:

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 3306 -u myusername --password mypassword
```

## Examples

SQL API exposes cubes as the tables where measures and dimensions are columns.

Consider the following schema.

```js
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    created: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

It would be represented as table in SQL API with `count`, `status`, `created`
columns.

```bash
mysql> DESCRIBE Orders;
+---------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type         | Null | Key  | Default | Extra |
+---------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+
| count   | int          | No   |      | NULL    |       |
| status  | varchar(255) | Yes  |      | NULL    |       |
| created | datetime     | Yes  |      | NULL    |       |
+---------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+
```

To get the count of orders grouped by status we can run the following query.

```
mysql> SELECT count, status FROM Orders;
+-------+------------+
| count | status     |
+-------+------------+
|  3354 | processing |
|  3346 | completed  |
|  3300 | shipped    |
+-------+------------+
```

Cube will automatically apply the `GROUP BY` clause in case it is missing in the
query. We can also provide the `GROUP BY` statement to control how results are
grouped. In the following example we group orders by created month and also by
status within every month.

```
mysql> SELECT
    ->   count,
    ->   status,
    ->   DATE(DATE_SUB(`created`, INTERVAL DAYOFMONTH(`created`) - 1 DAY)) date
    -> FROM Orders
    -> GROUP BY date, status
    -> ORDER BY date ASC;
+-------+------------+-------------------------+
| count | status     | date                    |
+-------+------------+-------------------------+
|    50 | processing | 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    48 | completed  | 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    57 | shipped    | 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    34 | shipped    | 2019-02-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    39 | processing | 2019-02-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    54 | completed  | 2019-02-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    75 | processing | 2019-03-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    62 | shipped    | 2019-03-01T00:00:00.000 |
|    77 | completed  | 2019-03-01T00:00:00.000 |
+-------+------------+-------------------------+
```

### Querying Dimensions

Querying dimensions is straightforward, simply add any required fields to the
`SELECT` clause.

```sql
mysql> SELECT status FROM Orders;
+------------+
| status     |
+------------+
| completed  |
| processing |
| shipped    |
+------------+
```

### Querying Measures

Measures can similarly be queried through Cube SQL.

Because measures are already aggregated in Cube there is no need to apply
aggregate functions to them in SQL API.

```
mysql> SELECT count FROM Orders;
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 10000 |
+-------+
```

Some of the BI systems may require you to apply aggregate functions. To support
this Cube allows aggregate functions on measures as long as they match the type
of the measure.

`count` measure in our example is of type `count`, It means we can apply
`COUNT()` aggregate function to it. The below query is similiar to the above
one.

```
mysql> SELECT COUNT(count) FROM Orders;
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 10000 |
+-------+
```

Let's look at more measures types:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  ...,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
    distinctCount: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `countDistinct`,
    },
    approxDistinctCount: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `countDistinctApprox`,
    },
    minValue: {
      sql: `min_value`,
      type: `min`
    },
    maxValue: {
      sql: `max_value`,
      type: `max`
    },
  },
})
```

As we can see, we have a mix of measure types in the above schema. To query
them, we could use the following SQL statements:

```sql
--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT count FROM Orders
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders

--- Count distinct, and count distinct approx
--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT distinctCount FROM Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT distinctCount) FROM Orders

--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT approxDistinctCount FROM Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT approxDistinctCount) FROM Orders

--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT minValue FROM Orders
SELECT MIN(minValue) FROM Orders

--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT maxValue FROM Orders
SELECT MAX(maxValue) FROM Orders
```

### Querying Segments

Any segments defined in a schema can also be used in Cube SQL queries. Looking
at the schema below, we have one segment `isCompleted`:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  ...,

  segments: {
    isCompleted: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`,
    },
  },
});
```

Segments must be used as `boolean` types in Cube SQL queries:

```sql
WHERE isCompleted = true
```

## Custom Authentication

Cube can be configured with dynamic username & password verification system by
setting a [`checkSqlAuth()`][ref-config-check-sql-auth] function in the
`cube.js` configuration file. This function should verify username and return
object with password and security context.

If password returned from this function matches provided in connection string
user will be authenticated with provided security context.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  checkSqlAuth: async (req, username) => {
    const userInfo = await getUserFromLDAP(username);
    if (userInfo) {
      return {
        password: 'mypassword',
        securityContext: {},
      };
    }

    throw new Error('Incorrect user name or password');
  },
};
```

## Limitations

### Projection

`SELECT` statements only support the following projections:

**`*` for all dimensions:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders;
```

**A valid expression for a dimension or measure:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders;
```

**A valid expression as an alias:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM Orders;
```

### Selection

Cube SQL supports most conditional checks for the `WHERE` clause.

**Comparison operators:**

```sql
WHERE price > 50
WHERE price >= 50 AND <= 100
```

**Boolean logic:**

```sql
WHERE isPaid = true
  AND isCompleted = false
  OR isReviewed = false
```

**`IN` operator:**:

```sql
WHERE status IN ('completed', 'shipped')
WHERE status NOT IN ('processing')
```

**`IS NULL`:**

```sql
WHERE completedAt IS NULL
WHERE completedAt IS NOT NULL
```

**`BETWEEN`:**

```sql
WHERE completedAt BETWEEN '2021-08-31' AND '2021-09-07'
WHERE createdAt NOT BETWEEN '2021-08-31' AND '2021-09-07'
```

**`LIKE`:**

```sql
WHERE name LIKE 'joe'
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'bloggs'
```

### Joins

SQL API currently does not support joins. We plan to support joins in future
releases.

As a workaround, it is possible to define proxy dimension or measure inside the
Cube.

```js
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.orders`,

  joins: {
    Users: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${Users}.id`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    // this is proxy dimension
    user_city: {
      sql: `${Users.city}`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`Users`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.users`,

  measures: {},

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    city: {
      sql: `city`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

Now, it is possible to get orders count by users city with the following query.

```
mysql> SELECT count, user_city FROM Orders;
+-------+---------------+
| count | userCity      |
+-------+---------------+
|  1416 | Los Angeles   |
|  1412 | Seattle       |
|  1365 | Mountain View |
|  1263 | New York      |
|  1220 | Austin        |
|  1164 | Chicago       |
|  1101 | San Francisco |
|  1059 | Palo Alto     |
+-------+---------------+
