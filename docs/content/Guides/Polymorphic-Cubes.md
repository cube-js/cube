[comment]: # (PROOFREAD: DONE)

In programming languages, polymorphism usually means **the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types**. 
It can be quite common for a database and application to be designed in such a way that leverages one single database table for entities of different types but sharing common traits. 

For example, you are working on an online education platform, where teachers assign lessons to students. 
The database can contain only two tables: one for `users` and another one for `lessons`. 
The `users` table can contain a `type` column, with possible values `teacher` or `student`. Here is how it could look:

|  **id** | **type** | **name** | **school** |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  1 | student | Carl Anderson | Balboa High School |
|  2 | student | Luke Skywalker | Balboa High School |
|  31 | teacher | John Doe | Balboa High School |

Lessons are assigned by teachers and completed by students. The `lessons` table has both `teacher_id` and `student_id`, which are actually references to the `user id`. 
The `lessons` table can look like this:

|  **id** | **teacher_id** | **student_id** | **name** |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  100 | 31 | 1 | Multiplication and the meaning of the Factors |
|  101 | 31 | 2 | Division as an Unknown Factor Problem |

The best way to design such a schema is by using what we call **Polymorphic Cubes**. 
It relies on the [extends](cube#parameters-extends) feature and prevents you from duplicating code, while preserving the correct domain logic.

The first step is to create a `User` cube, which will act as a base cube for our `Teachers` and `Students` cubes and will contain all common measures and dimensions.

```javascript
cube(`Users`, {
 sql: `select * from users`,

 measures: {
   count: {
     type: `count`
   }
 },

 dimensions: {
   name: {
     sql: `name`,
     type: `string`
   },

   school: {
     sql: `school`,
     type: `string`
   }
 }
});
```

Then you can extend the `Teachers` and `Students` cubes from `Users`.

```javascript
cube(`Teachers`, {
  extends: Users,
  sql: `select * from ${Users.sql()} where type = 'teacher'`
});

cube(`Students`, {
  extends: Users,
  sql: `select * from ${Users.sql()} where type = 'student'`
});
```

Once we have those cubes, we can define correct joins from the `Lessons` cube.

```javascript
cube(`Lessons`, {
 sql: `select * from lessons`,

 joins: {
   Students: {
     relationship: `belongsTo`,
     sql: `${CUBE}.student_id = ${Students}.id`
   },
   Teachers: {
     relationship: `belongsTo`,
     sql: `${CUBE}.teacher_id = ${Teachers}.id`
   }
 }
});
```

Now that we have all required cubes joined correctly, the last step is to **present it to end users in the Insights in an easy-to-consume way**. 
We donâ€™t want to show the `Users` cube so as to not confuse the end users. 
We can use the [context feature](context) for this and expose only `Lessons`, `Teachers`, and `Students` into the Insights.

```javascript
context(`Lessons`, {
  contextMembers: [Lessons, Students, Teachers]
});
```
