When you use partitioned rollups on immutable data there's an opportunity to
build pre-aggregations incrementally. Cube.js allows to set `refreshKey` in a
way that partitions in past would be never refreshed without a need which leads
to significant performance boost.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

As usually there're multiple cubes that require incremental partitions building
it's best practice to introduce separate `RefreshKeyHelper.js` file which will
contain this reusable logic. Typical immutable partition rollup will look like:

```javascript
const defaultRefreshKey = `DATE(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())`;

export const refreshKeySql = `select ${defaultRefreshKey}`;

export const immutablePartitionRollupRefreshKey = (filterFn) =>
  `SELECT CASE WHEN ${filterFn(
    (from, to) =>
      `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() < TIMESTAMP_ADD(TIMESTAMP(${to}), INTERVAL 72 HOUR)`
  )} THEN ${defaultRefreshKey} END`;
```

Here we use Standard BigQuery SQL dialect. To use this `refreshKey` with for
example `Events` table you can define `rollup` like this:

```javascript
import { immutablePartitionRollupRefreshKey } from './RefreshKeyHelper';

cube(`Events`, {
  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `rollup`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,

      // ...

      refreshKey: {
        sql: immutablePartitionRollupRefreshKey(
          FILTER_PARAMS.FirebaseEvents.time.filter
        ),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In this case SQL generated by `immutablePartitionRollupRefreshKey` returns
current date in case `to` date of partition is within 72 hours of current
timestamp. Otherwise it returns `NULL`. This behavior leads to partitions with
`NULL` keys would never refresh until it's SQL is changed.
