The Cube Cloud Developer Playground is mostly similar to the one available in
Cube.js with the notable difference of being able to query the Development Mode
API.

## Development Mode

After making changes to the schema through the [Cube IDE][ref-devtools-ide], the
API will restart and its status will be visible in the Playground:

<div
  style="text-align: center"
>
  <img
  alt="Playground during API restart"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Cube-Cloud/Developer-Tools/playground-restart.png"
  style="border: none"
  width="100%"
  />
</div>
