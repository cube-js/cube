Following Cube Cloud becoming generally available in October 2021, we've been
hard at work making improvements across the board. Let's have a quick run
through them:

## Database Connections

Cube Cloud now supports configuring your own specified SSL certificates when
connecting to databases. When creating a new deployment, check the 'SSL' box,
and paste the relevant SSL certificates:

![SSL configuration options on Set Up a Database Connection screen|496x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/336591951b312cdf38c5cd6a5883e0b1b86057a8.png)

## Git integration

We've made it really easy to quickly add more Git branches to your Cube Cloud
deployment and switch between them, just click the branch name in the status
bar:

![Branch switcher|685x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/68dd08d82e696646f8eb94c109cdeeec623272e9.png)

Speaking of Git branches, you can now easily add and remove branches with the
same switcher; click 'Add Branch' and enter a name for the new branch in the
popup:

![Create a new branch|690x431](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/f3a2e6f328ea207599cc784f1051a10b1d47ffa8.png)

These branches are shared; meaning everyone on your Cube Cloud team can see and
edit them. This makes them super useful for out-of-band experiments where you
can quickly test things in Cube Cloud without having to go through a CI/CD
process.

To round things off, you can also delete unused branches too; first make sure
you are already on the branch, then open the switcher and click 'Remove Branch':

![Delete a branch|685x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/93b46895de0cf8c1dfac85640438c4d30a56e767.png)

## GitHub integration

When connecting your GitHub repo to Cube Cloud, you can now choose a default
branch for deployments:

![Integrate with GitHub repository|690x440](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/2673d0d9e21fcdbc1ae9ec5658badcdc17e4eb24.png)

## Developer Mode

We've seen a round of improvements to the Cube Cloud Developer Mode experience.
When you're in Developer Mode, the status bar is now purple so you always know
when it's active:

![Development Mode now shows a purple status bar|690x431](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/e7e2349db8994cecce4979466d270280a85214dd.png)

If you've been editing a schema and navigate away, we warn you if there are any
unsaved changes:

![Unsaved changes warning modal|690x431](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/2f1f9c64ef6a6a6b66092bc38332f0c8bbced378.png)

And last but not least, we've added a new 'Generate Schema' button to the Schema
page. Clicking this will let you re-generate schemas from your source database,
or alternatively add rollups to existing schemas:

![Generate rollups or schema modal|690x428](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/ae01322061fa45357275939c10927d5339cd723b.png)

## Query Tracing

When inspecting queries in the Queries tab, you can now also see whether or not
the query used a pre-aggregation:

![Query showing pre-aggregation lightning mark|674x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/c953bbe2684339bc36fafaa1efb39202e18f85b2.jpeg)

If you click a query from the list, we now provide more relevant information,
like if the query built a pre-aggregation or not:

![Query request details|690x428](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/7160cd06f0888494f4409744ca472e0efb7a0449.png)

## SQL API

Following the release of the SQL API in Cube, we're happy to announce that you
can also use it in Cube Cloud. You can enable it by clicking 'Deploy SQL API'
from the Overview page, then click the 'How to connect your BI tool'. You should
then see something similar to the following:

![SQL API details modal|690x428](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/8501d40a2062967723b4de78af6e6b496f60be0b.png)

You can read more about the Cube SQL API
[in the documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/sql), and we even have
[a recipe that shows you how to connect the SQL API to Apache Superset](https://cube.dev/docs/recipes/using-apache-superset-with-cube-sql).

## GraphQL API

In parallel to the SQL API, we also are excited to announce a new GraphQL API.
You can copy itsâ€™ URL from the Overview page, just under the SQL API:

![GraphQL API|690x310](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cube1/original/1X/85dd23cf30bdd78b3ca5f4bd04ec925ab674c70b.png)

More information can be found
[in the documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/graphql); we hope you enjoy
using it as much as we are ðŸ¤“

## Other Notable Improvements

- When a deployment is connected to a Git monorepo, only commits to the Cube
  project folder will trigger a rebuild on Cube Cloud.
- When switching from `stable` track to `latest`, Cube Cloud will now
  automatically restart the deployment.
- `COMPILE_CONTEXT` now works correctly in Developer Mode.
- Automatically switch to Developer Mode after adding a rollup using the Rollup Designer.

That's all for this release, stay tuned for the release notes next time ðŸ˜€
