## Pricing

Cube Cloud pricing is based on consumption of compute power which we measure
using Cube Compute Units. The units are priced based on which subscription plan
you have chosen. Each plan has different features and functionality that you
should review as you think about what is right for your business.

<InfoBox heading="What's a Cube Compute Unit?">

A **Cube Compute Unit** is a way to measure compute power used to run Cube Cloud
infrastructure. The price of a compute unit is determined by the Cube Cloud plan
you're subscribed to.

</InfoBox>

| Node Type                 | Compute Unit per hour |
| ------------------------- | :-------------------: |
| Cube Production Cluster   |          `4`          |
| Cube Development Instance |          `1`          |
| Cube Store Worker         |          `1`          |
| Cube API Instance         |          `1`          |

Cube Cloud has four subscription plans that you can review on
[the main website](https://cube.dev/pricing). The subscription plan you choose
will determine the price per Cube Compute Unit (CCU). Each subscription plan
determines the features, scalability, availability, as well as the speed and
scope of support you may receive for your deployment.

## Development Instance

<InfoBox>

You can try a Development Instance for free - no credit card required. Your free
trial is limited to 2 development instances and only 1,000 queries per day.

</InfoBox>

</div>

Development Instances are designed for development use-cases only. This makes it
easy to get started with Cube Cloud quickly, and also allows you to build and
query pre-aggregations on-demand.

Development Instances do not provide high-availability nor do they guarantee
fast response times. Development Instances also hibernate after 60 minutes of
inactivity, which can cause the first request after hibernation to take
additional time to process. They also have a 10,000 queries per day limit, and
are limited to a maximum of 2 Cube Store Workers. We **strongly** advise not
using a development instance in a production environment, it is for testing and
learning about Cube only and will not deliver a production-level experience for
your users.

You can try a Cube Cloud development instance by
[signing up for Cube Cloud](https://cubecloud.dev/auth/signup) to try it free
(no credit card required).

## Production Cluster

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="High-level architecture diagram of a Cube Cloud Production Cluster"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/fcb57d7a-09ee-4854-9282-db443a5ee61d/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

Production Clusters are designed to support high-availability production
workloads. It consists of several key components, including starting with 2 Cube
API instances, 1 Cube Refresh Worker and 2 Cube Store Routers - all of which run
on dedicated infrastructure. The cluster can automatically scale to meet the
needs of your workload by adding more components as necessary; check the
[Limits section](#limits) below.

## Production Multi-Cluster

<InfoBox>

This deployment type is only available on **Enterprise Premier** plans. Please
[contact our sales team][cube-contact-us] if interested.

</InfoBox>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="High-level architecture diagram of a Cube Cloud Production Multi-Cluster"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/0ab1eb5c-7aba-4e9c-8951-1998d4b714f0/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

The Enterprise Premier version of Cube Cloud also makes it easy to deploy
Production Multi-Clusters, which allows for larger amounts of data as well as
load balancing for multi-tenant deployments with over 1,000 tenants. Each
additional cluster is charged separately, and all clusters can use auto-scaling
to match demand.

Cube Cloud routes traffic between the Production Clusters based on
[`contextToAppId()`][ref-conf-ref-ctx-to-app-id].

## Limits

Cube Cloud also allows adding additional infrastructure to your deployment to
increase scalability and performance beyond what is available with each
Production Deployment.

### Cube Store Worker

|                           | Free Tier | Starter | Premium | Enterprise |        Enterprise Premier        |
| ------------------------- | :-------: | :-----: | :-----: | :--------: | :------------------------------: |
| Maximum number of workers |     2     |   16    |   16    |     16     | [Talk to Sales][cube-contact-us] |

Cube Store Workers are used to build and persist pre-aggregations. Each Worker
has a **maximum of 150GB** of storage; additional Cube Store workers can be
added to your deployment to both increase storage space and improve
pre-aggregation performance. A **minimum of 2** Cube Store Workers is required
for pre-aggregations; this can be adjusted. For a rough estimate, it will take
approximately 2 Cube Store Workers per 4 gigs of pre-aggregated data per day.

To change the number of Cube Store Workers in a deployment, go to the
deployment’s Settings page, and open the Configuration tab. From this screen,
you can set the number of Cube Store Workers from the dropdown:

<div style="text-align: center">

    src="https://ucarecdn.com/3b39c56f-d553-4612-b4f0-07084cc4b742/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

### Cube API Instance

|                 | Free Tier | Starter |  Premium  | Enterprise | Enterprise Premier |
| --------------- | :-------: | :-----: | :-------: | :--------: | :----------------: |
| Queries per day |   1,000   | 200,000 | Unlimited | Unlimited  |     Unlimited      |

With a Production Deployment, 2 Cube API Instances are included. That said, it
is very common to use more, and additional Cube API instances can be added to
your deployment to increase the throughput of your queries. A rough estimate is
that 1 Cube API Instance is needed for every 5-10 requests-per-second served.
Cube API Instances can also auto-scale as needed.

To change how many Cube API instances are available in the Production Cluster,
go to the deployment’s Settings page, and open the Configuration tab. From this
screen, you can set the minimum and maximum number of Cube API instances for a
deployment:

## Switching between deployment types

To switch a deployment's type, go to the deployment's settings page and select
from the available options:
