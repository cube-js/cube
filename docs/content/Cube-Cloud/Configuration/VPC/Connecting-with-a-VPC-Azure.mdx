## Prerequisites

To allow Cube Cloud to connect to a Virtual Network on Azure, the following
information is required:

- **Virtual Network Name:** This can be found in the Virtual Networks section of
  the [Azure Portal][azure-console].
- **Tenant ID:** This can be found under Azure Active Directory > Properties >
  Tenant ID in the [Azure Portal][azure-console].

## Setup

Unfortunately Azure cross-tenant peering suppose that you grant peering role to
the user id/service principal to the peering party Below the list of steps that
would register Cube Cloud tenant at your organization and grant peering access
to Cube Cloud service principal

### Add Cube tenant to your organization

First the Cube Cloud tenant must be added to your organization. To do this,
open the [Azure Portal][azure-console] and go to Azure Active Directory > External
Identities > Cross-tenant access settings > Organizational Settings > Add
Organization.

For Tenant ID, enter `197e5263-87f4-4ce1-96c4-351b0c0c714a`. Make sure that
B2B Collaboration > Inbound Access > Applications is set (or inherited) so
that it `Allows access`

### Register Cube Cloud service principal at your organization

`Cube Cloud service principal`

info:
Client ID: `0c5d0d4b-6cee-402e-9a08-e5b79f199481`
Name: `cube-dedicated-infra-sp`

Using browser tab where account that has rights to register
`Enterprise applications` is logged in open the following url:
https://login.microsoftonline.com/**Tenant
ID\*\*/oauth2/authorize?client_id=0c5d0d4b-6cee-402e-9a08-e5b79f199481&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2F
Select `Consent on behalf of your organization` And click `Accept`

### Grant peering permissions to Cube Cloud service principal on your `Virtual Network`

As `peering role` you can use built-in `Network contributor` or custom role that
has the following permissions:

- Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/write
- Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/peer/action
- Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks/peer/action
- Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/read
- Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/delete

On the [Azure Portal][azure-console], go to `Virtual networks` > **Virtual
Network Name** > `Access Control (IAM)` > `Add` > `Add role assignment` Role =
`peering role` Members: `cube-dedicated-infra-sp`

### Firewall
