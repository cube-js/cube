With the Cube IDE, you can write and test and your Cube.js data schemas from
your browser. Cube Cloud can create branch-based development API instances to
quickly test changes in the data schema in your frontend applications before
pushing them into production.

## Development Mode

In development mode, you can safely make changes to your project without
affecting production deployment. Development mode uses a separate Git branch and
allows testing your changes in Playground or via a separate API endpoint
specific to this branch. This development API hot-reloads your schema changes,
allowing you to quickly test API changes from your applications.

To enter development mode, navigate to the **Schema** page and click **Enter
Development Mode**.

When development mode is active, a grey bar will be visible at the top of the
screen. It provides several useful controls and indicators:

- The name of the current development Git branch
- The status of the development API. After any changes to the project, the API
  will hot-reload, and the API status will indicate when it's ready.
- 'Copy API URL' will copy the API URL to the clipboard for the current
  development branch.

You can exit development mode by clicking **Exit** button in the grey banner.
