Whenever development mode is enabled, a new set of API endpoints specifically
for the branch is enabled. This is useful for testing and debugging schemas in
an isolated environment before releasing to production.

## Finding endpoints

After entering Development Mode, go to the Overview page to see all available
endpoints for the branch:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Development Mode Overview page showing available endpoints"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/85d92844-09bd-4254-a87c-e19ae6989da5/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Limitations

The Development API has some limitations compared to Production, and it is
important to be aware of these as they may affect your development process.

### Autoscaling

The Development API **does not** support autoscaling. If you need to test
autoscaling, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a different Git
branch of the same repository.

### Scheduled refresh

Scheduled refresh is also disabled in the Development API. If you need to test
scheduled refreshes, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a
different Git branch of the same repository.

### Cube version guarantees

The version of Cube used in the Development API **is not** guaranteed to be the
same each time. If this affects your development process, we recommend reaching
out to our support team.
