The Cube Cloud Developer Playground is mostly similar to the one available in
Cube.js with the notable difference of being able to query the Development Mode
API.

## Development Mode

After making changes to the schema through the [Cube IDE][ref-devtools-ide], the
API will restart and its status will be visible in the Playground:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Playground during API restart"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/ee419318-7021-4f77-ac62-215ef40292d7/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>
