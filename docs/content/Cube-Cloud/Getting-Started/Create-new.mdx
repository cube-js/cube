This guide walks you through setting up Cube Cloud and connecting your Cube
project to your database.

## Step 1: Create an account

Navigate to [cubecloud.dev](https://cubecloud.dev/), and create a new Cube Cloud
account.

## Step 2: Create a new Deployment

Click the `Create Deployment` button. This is the first step in the deployment
creation. Give it a name and select the cloud provider and region of your
choice.

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Step 3: Set up the Cube project from scratch

Next up, the second step in creating a Cube App from scratch in Cube Cloud is to
click the `+ create` button.

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Step 4: Connect your Database

Enter your credentials to connect to your database. Check the [connecting to
databases][link-connecting-to-databases] guide for more details.

Want to use a sample database instead? We also have a sample database where you
can try out Cube Cloud:

<br />

| Field    | Value              |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Host     | `demo-db.cube.dev` |
| Port     | `5432`             |
| Database | `ecom`             |
| Username | `cube`             |
| Password | `12345`            |

</InfoBox>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Setup Database Screen"
    src="https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1375f9f1-0860-412a-a436-e2e775ec10fa.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

In the UI it'll look exactly like the image below.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Setup Database Screen"
    src="https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/031bb948-d706-412c-b714-5bf28df01312.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

If you run into issues here, make sure to allow the Cube Cloud IPs to access
your database. This means you need to enable these IPs in your firewall. If you
are using AWS, this would mean adding a security group with allowed IPs.

## Step 5: Generate the Data Schema

Step four in this case consists of generating a data schema. Start by selecting
the database tables to generate the data schema from, then hit `generate`.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Setup Database Screen"
    src="https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a906434b-c4da-414a-adb3-f010b1fa45d1.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

Cube Cloud will generate the data schema and spin up your Cube deployment. With
this, you're done. You've created a Cube deployment, configured a database
connection, and generated a data schema!

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Cloud Setup Database Screen"
    src="https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/b6addada-cc77-4940-aa0c-a0a9c3df6fd1.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

You're ready for the last step, running queries in the Playground.

## Step 6: Try out Cube Cloud

Now you can navigate to Playground to try out your queries or connect your
application to Cube Cloud API.

    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Cube-Cloud/getting-started-4.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>
