This guide demonstrates how to set up Cube Cloud to forward logs to a hosted Loki
instance on Grafana Cloud.

To enable log export, first go to the deployment's settings page and turn it on:

## Secrets

<InfoBox>

Only environment variables prefixed with `CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_` can be
referenced in the `vector.toml` configuration file.

</InfoBox>

First, go to your deployment's environment variables, then add the
authentication credentials for the Grafana Cloud-hosted Loki instance. We can
define as many environment variables as we need, but we must prefix them with
`CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_` so that we can use them in our Vector configuration
file later.

## Vector

Now, enter Development Mode and add a file called `vector.toml` to your Cube
project. Open the newly-created file, and then add any relevant sink
configuration. We'll also want to use the environment variables we defined
earlier:

```toml
[sinks.loki]
type = "loki"
inputs = [ "cubejs-server", "refresh-scheduler", "ext-db" ]
endpoint = "https://logs-prod-us-central1.grafana.net"

[sinks.loki.encoding]
codec = "json"

[sinks.loki.labels]
app = "cube-cloud"
env = "production"

[sinks.loki.auth]
strategy = "basic"
user = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_USER"
password = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_PASS"

[sinks.loki_cubestore]
type = "loki"
inputs = [ "cubestore" ]
endpoint = "https://logs-prod-us-central1.grafana.net"

[sinks.loki_cubestore.encoding]
codec = "json"

[sinks.loki_cubestore.labels]
app = "cube-store"
env = "production"

[sinks.loki_cubestore.auth]
strategy = "basic"
user = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_USER"
password = "$CUBE_CLOUD_LOG_EXPORT_LOKI_PASS"

[sinks.loki_cubestore.cubestore]
levels = [ "trace", "info", "debug", "error" ]
```

Once done, save the file and commit it to your repository. Once you're back on
the&nbsp;<Btn>Overview</Btn> page, you should now see a
new&nbsp;<Btn>Log Export</Btn> resource:
