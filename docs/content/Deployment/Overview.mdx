This section contains a general overview of deploying a Cube cluster in
production. You can also check platform-specific guides for [Cube
Cloud][ref-deploy-cubecloud] and [Docker][ref-deploy-docker].

If you are moving Cube to production, check out the [Production
Checklist][ref-deploy-prod-list].

## Components

As shown in the diagram below, a typical production deployment of Cube includes
the following components:

- One or multiple API instances
- A Refresh Worker
- A Cube Store cluster

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

**API Instances** process incoming API requests and query either Cube Store for
pre-aggregated data or connected database(s) for raw data. The **Refresh
Worker** builds and refreshes pre-aggregations in the background. **Cube Store**
ingests pre-aggregations built by Refresh Worker and responds to queries from
API instances.

API instances and Refresh Workers can be configured via [environment
variables][ref-config-env] or the [`cube.js` configuration file][ref-config-js].
They also need access to the data schema files. Cube Store clusters can be
configured via environment variables.

You can find an example Docker Compose configuration for a Cube deployment in
the platform-specific guide for [Docker][ref-deploy-docker].

## API instances

API instances process incoming API requests and query either Cube Store for
pre-aggregated data or connected data sources for raw data. It is possible to
horizontally scale API instances and use a load balancer to balance incoming
requests between multiple API instances.

The [Cube Docker image][dh-cubejs] is used for API Instance.

API instance needs to be configured via environment variables, cube.js file and
has access to the data schema files.

## Refresh Worker

A Refresh Worker updates pre-aggregations and invalidates the in-memory cache in
the background. They also keep the refresh keys up-to-date for all defined
schemas and pre-aggregations. Please note that the in-memory cache is just
invalidated but not populated by Refresh Worker. In-memory cache is populated
lazily during querying. On the other hand, pre-aggregations are eagerly
populated and kept up-to-date by Refresh Worker.

[Cube Docker image][dh-cubejs] can be used for creating Refresh Workers; to make
the service act as a Refresh Worker, `CUBEJS_REFRESH_WORKER=true` should be set
in the environment variables.

## Cube Store

Cube Store is the purpose-built pre-aggregations storage for Cube.

Cube Store uses a distributed query engine architecture. In every Cube Store
cluster:

- a one or many [router nodes](#cube-store-cube-store-router) handle incoming
  connections, manages database metadata, builds query plans, and orchestrates
  their execution
- multiple [worker nodes](#cube-store-cube-store-worker) ingest warmed up data
  and execute queries in parallel
- a local or cloud-based blob storage keeps pre-aggregated data in columnar
  format

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

By default, Cube Store listens on the port `3030` for queries coming from Cube.
The port could be changed by setting `CUBESTORE_HTTP_PORT` environment variable.
In a case of using custom port, please make sure to change
`CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_PORT` environment variable for Cube API Instances and Refresh
Worker.

Both the router and worker use the [Cube Store Docker image][dh-cubestore]. The
following environment variables should be used to manage the roles:

| Environment Variable    | Specify on Router? | Specify on Worker? |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME` | Yes                | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_META_PORT`   | Yes                | -                  |
| `CUBESTORE_WORKERS`     | Yes                | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT` | -                  | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_META_ADDR`   | -                  | Yes                |

### <--{"id" : "Cube Store"}--> Cube Store Router

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Store Router with two Cube Store Workers"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/bfc4f46a-09c2-4e2d-a8e8-8bb6177bb5ff/"

</div>

The Router in a Cube Store cluster is responsible for receiving queries from
Cube, managing metadata for the Cube Store cluster, and query planning and
distribution for the Workers. It also [provides a MySQL-compatible
interface][ref-caching-inspect-sql] that can be used to query pre-aggregations
from Cube Store directly. Cube **only** communicates with the Router, and does
not interact with Workers directly.

  /caching/using-pre-aggregations#inspecting-pre-aggregations

### <--{"id" : "Cube Store"}--> Cube Store Worker

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Cube Store Router with two Cube Store Workers"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/bedc67d5-b8ab-447f-8d7a-0176487e02a5/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

Workers in a Cube Store cluster receive and execute subqueries from the Router,
and directly interact with the underlying distributed storage for insertions,
selections and pre-aggregation warmup. Workers **do not** interact with each
other directly, and instead rely on the Router to distribute queries and manage
any associated metadata.

### <--{"id" : "Cube Store"}--> Scaling

Although Cube Store _can_ be run in single-instance mode, this is often
unsuitable for production deployments. For high concurrency and data throughput,
we **strongly** recommend running Cube Store as a cluster of multiple instances
instead. Because the storage layer is decoupled from the query processing
engine, you can horizontally scale your Cube Store cluster for as much
concurrency as you require.

A sample Docker Compose stack setting Cube Store cluster up might look like:

```yaml
version: '2.2'

services:
  cubestore_router:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:10001,cubestore_worker_2:10002
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
      - CUBESTORE_META_PORT=9999
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_router:9999
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_worker_1
      - cubestore_worker_2

  cubestore_worker_1:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:10001,cubestore_worker_2:10002
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_1:10001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=10001
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data

  cubestore_worker_2:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:10001,cubestore_worker_2:10002
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_2:10002
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=10002
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
```

### <--{"id" : "Cube Store"}--> Storage

Cube Store makes use of a separate storage layer for storing metadata as well as
for persisting pre-aggregations as Parquet files. Cube Store can use both AWS S3
and Google Cloud, or if desired, a local path on the server if all nodes of a
cluster run on a single machine.

A simplified example using AWS S3 might look like:

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  cubestore_router:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_META_PORT=9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_S3_BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_S3_REGION=<BUCKET_REGION_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
  cubestore_worker_1:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=9001
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_S3_BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_S3_REGION=<BUCKET_REGION_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
```

## Redis

Earlier, [Redis][redis] was used in production deployments as storage for
in-memory cache and query queue. Since version v0.32.0, Cube Store is used for
that purpose. It is still possible to [configure][ref-config-redis] Cube to use
Redis; however, it is strongly not recommended. Please check the [blog
post][blog-details] for details.

<WarningBox>

Redis support is deprecated and will be removed from Cube in the future. Upgrade
to v0.32.0 or later to use Cube Store instead of Redis. See the [migration
guide][blog-migration-guide].
