Thinking of migrating to the cloud instead? [Click
here][blog-migrate-to-cube-cloud] to learn more about migrating a self-hosted
installation to [Cube Cloud][link-cube-cloud].

</InfoBox>

This is a checklist for configuring and securing Cube for a production
deployment.

## Disable Development Mode

When running Cube in production environments, make sure development mode is
disabled both on API Instances and Refresh Worker. Running Cube in development
mode in a production environment can lead to security vulnerabilities. You can
read more on the differences between [production and development mode
here][link-cubejs-dev-vs-prod].

<InfoBox>

Development mode is disabled by default.

</InfoBox>

```dotenv
# Set this to false or leave unset to disable development mode
CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=false
```

## Set up Refresh Worker

To refresh in-memory cache and [pre-aggregations][ref-schema-ref-preaggs] in the
background, we recommend running a separate Cube Refresh Worker instance. This
allows your Cube API Instance to continue to serve requests with high
availability.

```dotenv
# Set to true so a Cube instance acts as a refresh worker
CUBEJS_REFRESH_WORKER=true
```

## Set up Cube Store

<WarningBox>

While Cube can operate with in-memory cache and queue storage, there're multiple
parts of Cube which require Cube Store in production mode. Replicating Cube
instances without Cube Store can lead to source database degraded performance,
various race conditions and cached data inconsistencies.

</WarningBox>

Cube Store manages in-memory cache, queue and pre-aggregations for Cube. Follow
the [instructions here][ref-caching-cubestore] to set it up.

Depending on your database, Cube may need to "stage" pre-aggregations inside
your database first before ingesting them into Cube Store. In this case, Cube
will require write access to the `prod_pre_aggregations` schema inside your
database. The schema name can be modified by the
[`CUBEJS_PRE_AGGREGATIONS_SCHEMA`][ref-conf-ref-env-preaggs-schema] environment
variable; see the [Environment Variables reference][ref-env-vars] for more
details.

<InfoBox>

You may consider enabling an export bucket which allows Cube to build large
pre-aggregations in a much faster manner. It is currently supported for
BigQuery, Redshift and Snowflake. Check [the relevant documentation for your
configured database][ref-config-connect-db] to set it up.

</InfoBox>

## Secure the deployment

If you're using JWTs, you can configure Cube to correctly decode them and inject
their contents into the [Security Context][ref-sec-ctx]. Add your authentication
provider's configuration under [the `jwt` property of your `cube.js`
configuration file][ref-config-jwt], or if using environment variables, see
`CUBEJS_JWK_*`, `CUBEJS_JWT_*` in the [Environment Variables
reference][ref-env-vars].

## Set up health checks

Cube provides [Kubernetes-API compatible][link-k8s-healthcheck-api] health check
(or probe) endpoints that indicate the status of the deployment. Configure your
monitoring service of choice to use the [`/readyz`][ref-api-readyz] and
[`/livez`][ref-api-livez] API endpoints so you can check on the Cube
deployment's health and be alerted to any issues.
