Thinking of migrating to the cloud instead? [Click
here][blog-migrate-to-cube-cloud] to learn more about migrating a self-hosted
installation to [Cube Cloud][link-cube-cloud].

</InfoBox>

This is a checklist for configuring and securing Cube.js for a production
deployment.

## Disable Development Mode

When running Cube.js in production environments, make sure development mode is
disabled both on API Instances and Refresh Worker. Running Cube.js in
development mode in a production environment can lead to security
vulnerabilities. You can read more on the differences between [production and
development mode here][link-cubejs-dev-vs-prod].

<InfoBox>

Development mode is disabled by default.

</InfoBox>

```bash
# Set this to false or leave unset to disable development mode
CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=false
```

## Set up Refresh Worker

To refresh in-memory cache and [pre-aggregations][ref-schema-ref-preaggs] in the
background, we recommend running a separate Cube.js Refresh Worker instance.
This allows your Cube.js API Instance to continue to serve requests with high
availability.

```bash
# Set to true so a Cube.js instance acts as a refresh worker
CUBEJS_REFRESH_WORKER=true
```

## Set up Cube Store

Cube Store is the purpose-built pre-aggregations storage for Cube.js. Follow the
[instructions here][ref-caching-cubestore] to set it up.

Depending on your database, Cube.js may need to "stage" pre-aggregations inside
your database first before ingesting them into Cube Store. In this case, Cube.js
will require write access to the `prod_pre_aggregations` schema inside your
database. The schema name can be modified by the
`CUBEJS_PRE_AGGREGATIONS_SCHEMA` environment variable; see the [Environment
Variables][ref-env-vars-general] page for more details.

<InfoBox>

You may consider enabling an export bucket which allows Cube.js to build large
pre-aggregations in a much faster manner. It is currently supported for
BigQuery, Redshift and Snowflake. Check [the relevant documentation for your
configured database][ref-config-connect-db] to set it up.

</InfoBox>

## Set up Redis

<WarningBox>

Cube Store [will replace
Redis][replace-redis] for in-memory cache and queue management in late
2022.

</WarningBox>

Cube.js requires [Redis](https://redis.io/), an in-memory data structure store,
to run in production.

It uses Redis for query caching and queue. Set the `CUBEJS_REDIS_URL`
environment variable to allow Cube.js to connect to Redis. If your Redis
instance also has a password, please set it via the `CUBEJS_REDIS_PASSWORD`
environment variable. Set the `CUBEJS_REDIS_TLS` environment variable to `true`
if you want to enable SSL-secured connections. Ensure your Redis cluster allows
at least 15 concurrent connections.

### <--{"id" : "Set up Redis"}--> Redis Sentinel

Redis provides functionality for high availability through
[`Redis Sentinel`][link-redis-sentinel].

For Redis Sentinel support, the npm package [`ioredis`][gh-ioredis] needs to be
used instead of[`redis`][gh-node-redis]. This is done by setting the
`CUBEJS_REDIS_USE_IOREDIS` environment variable to `true`. Then set
`CUBEJS_REDIS_URL` to the
`redis+sentinel://localhost:26379,otherhost:26479/mymaster/5` to allow Cube.js
to connect to the Redis Sentinel.

<WarningBox>

Cube.js server instances used by same tenant environments should have same Redis
instances. Otherwise they will have different query queues which can lead to
incorrect pre-aggregation states and intermittent data access errors.

</WarningBox>

### <--{"id" : "Set up Redis"}--> Redis Pool

If `CUBEJS_REDIS_URL` is provided Cube.js, will create a Redis connection pool
with a minimum of 2 and maximum of 1000 concurrent connections, by default. The
`CUBEJS_REDIS_POOL_MIN` and `CUBEJS_REDIS_POOL_MAX` environment variables can be
used to tweak pool size limits. To disable connection pooling, and instead
create connections on-demand, you can set `CUBEJS_REDIS_POOL_MAX` to 0.

If your maximum concurrent connections limit is too low, you may see
`TimeoutError: ResourceRequest timed out` errors. As a rule of a thumb, you need
to have `Queue Size * Number of tenants` concurrent connections to ensure the
best performance possible. If you use clustered deployments, please make sure
you have enough connections for all Cube.js server instances. A lower number of
connections still can work, however Redis becomes a performance bottleneck in
this case.

### <--{"id" : "Set up Redis"}--> Running without Redis

If you want to run Cube.js in production without Redis, you can use
`CUBEJS_CACHE_AND_QUEUE_DRIVER` environment variable to `memory`.

<WarningBox>

Serverless and clustered deployments can't be run without Redis as it is used to
manage the query queue.

</WarningBox>

## Secure the deployment

If you're using JWTs, you can configure Cube.js to correctly decode them and
inject their contents into the [Security Context][ref-sec-ctx]. Add your
authentication provider's configuration under [the `jwt` property of your
`cube.js` configuration file][ref-config-jwt], or use [the corresponding
environment variables (`CUBEJS_JWK_URL`,
`CUBEJS_JWT_*`)][ref-config-env-vars-general].

## Set up health checks

Cube.js provides [Kubernetes-API compatible][link-k8s-healthcheck-api] health
check (or probe) endpoints that indicate the status of the deployment. Configure
your monitoring service of choice to use the [`/readyz`][ref-api-readyz] and
[`/livez`][ref-api-livez] API endpoints so you can check on the Cube.js
deployment's health and be alerted to any issues.
