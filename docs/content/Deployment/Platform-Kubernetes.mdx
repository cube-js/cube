This guide walks you through deploying Cube.js with [Kubernetes][k8s]. This
particular deployment makes use of a `hostPath` volume to mount schema files
into the containers.

<WarningBox>

This is an example of a production-ready deployment, but real-world deployments
can vary significantly depending on desired performance and scale. For an
example of deploying with [Helm][helm-k8s] or plain [Kubernetes][k8s], check out
the respective examples [here][gh-cubejs-examples-k8s-helm] and
[here][gh-cube-examples-k8s].

</WarningBox>

## Prerequisites

- [Kubernetes][k8s]

## Configuration

### <--{"id" : "Configuration"}--> Create Cube.js API instance and Refresh Worker

To deploy Cube.js, we will use [`Deployment`][k8s-docs-deployment]s and
[Service][k8s-docs-service]s. We'll start by creating a Redis deployment in a
file called `redis-deployment.yaml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/redis-deployment.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

And a corresponding service for the Redis deployment in a file named
`redis-service.yaml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/redis-service.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

Next, create a file called `cube-api-deployment.yaml` with the following
contents:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/cube-api-deployment.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

The exact set of `CUBEJS_DB_*` environment variables depends on your database;
please reference [Connecting to the Database page][ref-config-db] for specific
configuration instructions.

We'll also create a corresponding service for this deployment in a file called
`cube-api-service.yaml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/cube-api-service.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

Now that we've configured our Cube.js API, let's also set up a deployment for a
Refresh Worker in `cube-refresh-worker-deployment.yaml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/cube-refresh-worker-deployment.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

### <--{"id" : "Configuration"}--> Create Cube Store Router and Worker nodes

With our Cube.js API and Refresh Worker set up, we can now begin setting up Cube
Store. We will make two [`StatefulSet`][k8s-docs-statefulset]s with
corresponding [Service][k8s-docs-service]s; one for the router node and one for
the worker nodes.

Create a new file called `cubestore-router-statefulset.yaml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/cubestore-router-statefulset.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

And a corresponding service declaration in a file called
`cubestore-router-service.yaml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/cubestore-router-service.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

With the router set up, let's move onto setting up our worker nodes. Let's
create a new file called `cubestore-workers-statefulset.yaml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/cubestore-workers-statefulset.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

Next, create its corresponding service in `cubestore-workers-service.yaml`. By
specifying `clusterIP: None`, you create a [headless
service][k8s-docs-headless-svc]. For this use case, a headless service is the
better solution.

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/cubestore-workers-service.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

## Set up reverse proxy

In production, the Cube.js API should be served over an HTTPS connection to
ensure security of the data in-transit. We recommend using a reverse proxy; as
an example, let's assume we're running the Kubernetes cluster on a cloud
provider such as AWS or GCP. We'll also assume we already have the SSL
certificate and key available on our local filesystem.

<InfoBox>

You can also use a reverse proxy to enable HTTP 2.0 and GZIP compression

</InfoBox>

First, we'll run the following to create a secret in Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls <NAME_OF_CERTIFICATE> --key <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> --cert <PATH_TO_CERT_FILE>
```

Next, we'll create a new ingress rule in a file called `ingress.yml`:

<GitHubCodeBlock
  href="cube-js/cube.js/master/examples/kubernetes/cluster/ingress.yaml"
  lang="yaml"
/>

<InfoBox>

For more advanced configuration, or for platforms where ingress is manually
managed, please refer to the Kubernetes documentation for [Ingress
Controllers][k8s-docs-ingress-controllers]. You can also find an [example of an
Ingress Controller here][gh-cubejs-examples-k8s-ingress-ctrl].

</InfoBox>

## Security

### <--{"id" : "Security"}--> Use JSON Web Tokens

Cube.js can be configured to use industry-standard JSON Web Key Sets for
securing its API and limiting access to data. To do this, we'll define the
relevant options on our Cube.js API instance and Refresh Worker deployments:

<WarningBox>

If you're using [`queryRewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite] for access control,
then you must also configure
[`scheduledRefreshContexts`][ref-config-sched-ref-ctx] so the refresh workers
can correctly create pre-aggregations.

</WarningBox>

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
          ...
          - name: CUBEJS_JWK_URL
            value: https://cognito-idp.<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/<USER_POOL_ID>/.well-known/jwks.json
          - name: CUBEJS_JWT_AUDIENCE
            value: <APPLICATION_URL>
          - name: CUBEJS_JWT_ISSUER
            value: https://cognito-idp.<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/<USER_POOL_ID>
          - name: CUBEJS_JWT_ALGS
            value: RS256
          - name: CUBEJS_JWT_CLAIMS_NAMESPACE
            value: <CLAIMS_NAMESPACE>
```

### <--{"id" : "Security"}--> Securing Cube Store

All Cube Store nodes, both router and workers, should only be accessible to
Cube.js API instances and refresh workers. To do this with Kubernetes, we need
to make sure that none of the Cube Store services are exposed in our Ingress
configuration. The Cube Store services should only be accessible from other
services within the cluster.

## Monitoring

All Cube.js logs can be found through the Kubernetes CLI:

```bash
kubectl logs
```

## Update to the latest version

Specify the tag for the Docker image available from [Docker
Hub][dockerhub-cubejs] (currently `v%CURRENT_VERSION`). Then update your
`cube-api-deployment.yaml` and `cube-refresh-deployment.yaml` to use the new
tag:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cube-api
          image: cubejs/cube:v%CURRENT_VERSION
```

Similarly, for `cubestore-router-statefulset.yaml` and
`cubestore-workers-statefulset.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cube-api
          image: cubejs/cubestore:v%CURRENT_VERSION
```
