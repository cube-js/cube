<SuccessBox>

Auto-suspension is available in Cube Cloud on
[Starter and above tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

Cube Cloud can automatically suspend deployments when not in use to prevent
[resource consumption][ref-deployment-pricing] when infrastructure is not being
actively used, which helps manage spend and preventing unnecessary quota use.

This is useful for deployments that are not used 24/7, such as staging
deployments. Auto-suspension will hibernate the deployment when **no** API
requests are received after a period of time, and automatically resume the
deployment when API requests start coming in again:

</div>

[Development Instances][ref-deployment-dev-instance] are auto-suspended
automatically when not in use for 10 minutes, whereas [Production
Clusters][ref-deployment-prod-cluster] and [Production
Multi-Clusters][ref-deployment-prod-multi-cluster] can auto-suspend after no API
requests were received within a configurable time period. While suspended,
[pre-aggregation][ref-caching-preaggs-gs] builds will also be paused to prevent
unnecessary resource consumption.

## Configuration

To configure auto-suspension settings, navigate to the <Btn>Settings</Btn>
screen in your deployment and click the <Btn>Configuration</Btn> tab, then
ensure <Btn>Enable Auto-suspend</Btn> is turned on:

/>

To configure how long Cube Cloud should wait before suspending the deployment,
adjust <Btn>Auto-suspend threshold (minutes)</Btn> to the desired value and
click <Btn>Apply</Btn>:

/>

The Cube API instances will temporarily become unavailable while they are
configured; this usually takes less than a minute.

## Resuming a suspended deployment

To resume a suspended deployment, send a query to Cube using the API or by
navigating to the deployment in Cube Cloud.

<WarningBox>

Currently, Cube Cloud's auto-suspension feature cannot guarantee a 100% resume
rate on the first query or a specific time frame for resume. While in most
cases, deployment resumes within several seconds of the first query, there is
still a possibility that it may take longer to resume your deployment. This can
potentially lead to an error response code for the initial query.

</WarningBox>

Deployments typically resume in under 30 seconds, but can take significantly
longer in certain situations depending on two major factors:

- **Data model:** How many cubes and views are defined.
- **Query complexity:** How complicated the queries being sent to the API are

Complex data models take more time to compile, and complex queries can cause
response times to be significantly longer than usual.
