Auto-suspension is available in Cube Cloud on
[Starter and above tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

Cube Cloud can automatically suspend deployments when not in use to prevent
[resource consumption][ref-deployment-pricing] when infrastructure is not being
actively used, which helps manage spend and preventing unnecessary quota use.

This is useful for deployments that are not used 24/7, such as staging
deployments. Auto-suspension will hibernate the deployment when **no** API requests
are received after a period of time, and automatically resume the deployment
when API requests start coming in again:

</div>

[Development Instances][ref-deployment-dev-instance] are auto-suspended
automatically when not in use for 10 minutes, whereas [Production
Clusters][ref-deployment-prod-cluster] and [Production
Multi-Clusters][ref-deployment-prod-multi-cluster] can auto-suspend after no API
requests were received within a configurable time period.

## Configuration

To configure auto-suspension settings, navigate to the <Btn>Settings</Btn> screen
in your deployment and click the <Btn>Configuration</Btn> tab, then ensure&nbsp;
&ZeroWidthSpace;<Btn>Enable Auto-suspend</Btn> is turned on:

/>

To configure how long Cube Cloud should wait before suspending the deployment,
adjust <Btn>Auto-suspend threshold (minutes)</Btn> to the desired value and
click <Btn>Apply</Btn>:

/>

The Cube API instances will temporarily become unavailable while they are
configured; this usually takes less than a minute.

## Resuming a suspended deployment

To resume a suspended deployment, send a query to Cube via either the API or
the&nbsp;<Btn>Playground</Btn> screen in Cube Cloud.

<InfoBox>

Opening the deployment in Cube Cloud will also resume the deployment, this is
because Cube Cloud sends API requests to fetch the deployment details. API
requests sent to [Development Mode][ref-workspace-dev-api] will also resume the
deployment.

</InfoBox>

Deployments typically resume in under 30 seconds, but can take significantly
longer in certain situations depending on two major factors:

- **Data model:** How many cubes and views are defined.
- **Query complexity:** How complicated the queries being sent to the API are

Complex data models take more time to compile, and complex queries can cause
response times to be significantly longer than usual.
