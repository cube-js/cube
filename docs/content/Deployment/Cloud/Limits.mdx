Cube Cloud implements limits on resource usage on account and deployment
levels to ensure the best experience for all Cube Cloud users.

<SuccessBox>

Limits apply to Cube Cloud accounts on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

## Limit types

Each limit can be of one of the following types:

- *Hard limit* either has a threshold that can't be exceeded or prevents
further use of a resource when a threshhold is hit until a cool-down period
passes (e.g., until the next day starts) or the limit is increased (e.g.,
when a Cube Cloud account upgrades to another tier).
- *Soft limit* may allow further use of a resource after a threshold is hit.

## Resources

The following resources are subject to limits, depending on [deployment types][ref-deployment-types] and
[pricing tiers][ref-pricing]:

| Resource                                                        | Free Tier | Starter   | Premium   | Enterprise | Enterprise Premier            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: |
| Number of deployments                                           | 2         | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited  | Unlimited                     |

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Number of deployments

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Number of API instances

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Number of Cube Store workers

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Queries per day

This is a hard limit. When a threshold is hit, further queries will not be
processed. In that case, consider upgrading a development instance to a
production cluster. Alternatively, consider upgrading to
[another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Queries processed by Query History per day

This is a soft limit. When a threshold is hit, query processing will be
stopped. Please [contact support][cube-contact-us] for further assistance.
