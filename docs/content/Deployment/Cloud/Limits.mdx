Cube Cloud implements limits on resource usage on account and deployment
levels to ensure the best experience for all Cube Cloud users.

<SuccessBox>

Limits apply to Cube Cloud accounts on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

## Limit types

Each limit can be of one of the following types:

- *Hard limit* either has a threshold that can't be exceeded or prevents
further use of a resource when a threshhold is hit until a cool-down period
passes (e.g., until the next day starts) or the limit is increased (e.g.,
when a Cube Cloud account upgrades to another tier).
- *Soft limit* may allow further use of a resource after a threshold is hit.

## Resources

The following resources are subject to limits, depending on [deployment types][ref-deployment-types] and
[pricing tiers][ref-pricing]:

| Resource                                                        | Free Tier | Starter   | Premium   | Enterprise | Enterprise Premier            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: |
| Number of deployments                                           | 2         | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited  | Unlimited                     |
| Number of API instances                                         | 1         | 20        | 20        | 20         | [Contact us][cube-contact-us] |

| Queries per day ([development instance][ref-dev-instance])      | 1,000     | 10,000    | Unlimited | Unlimited  | Unlimited                     |
| Queries per day ([production cluster][ref-prod-cluster])        | —         | 50,000    | Unlimited | Unlimited  | Unlimited                     |
| Queries processed by [Query History][ref-query-history] per day | 1,000     | 50,000    | 100,000   | 200,000    | 300,000                       |

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Number of deployments

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Number of API instances

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Number of Cube Store workers

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Queries per day

This is a hard limit. Usage is calculated per Cube Cloud account, i.e.,
in total for all deployments within an account.

When a threshold is hit, further queries will not be processed. In that
case, consider upgrading a development instance to a production cluster.
Alternatively, consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### <--{"id" : "Resources"}--> Queries processed by Query History per day

This is a soft limit. Usage is calculated per Cube Cloud account, i.e.,
in total for all deployments within an account.

When a threshold is hit, query processing will be stopped. Please
[contact support][cube-contact-us] for further assistance.
