Lambda pre-aggregations follow the
[Lambda architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture) design
to union real-time and batch data. Cube acts as a serving layer and uses
pre-aggregations as a batch layer and source data or other pre-aggregations,
usually [streaming][streaming-pre-agg], as a speed layer.

<WarningBox>

Lambda pre-aggregations only work with Cube Store.

Additionally, weâ€™re going to remove support for external storages, other than
Cube Store, later this year. [Cube Store will replace
Redis][cube-blog-replace-redis] and, therefore will be a required component to
run Cube even without pre-aggregations.

## Use cases

Below we are looking at the most common examples of using lambda
pre-aggregations.

### Batch and source data

Batch data is coming from pre-aggregation and real-time data is coming from the
data source.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Lambda pre-aggregation batch and source diagram"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Caching/lambda-batch-source.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

First, you need to create pre-aggregations that will contain your batch data. In
the following example, we call it **batch.** Please note, it must have
`timeDimension`, and Cube will use it to union batch data with source data.

You control the batch part of your data with `buildRangeStart` and
`buildRangeEnd` properties of pre-aggregation to determine specific window for
your batched data.

Next, you need to create a lambda pre-aggregation. To do that, create
pre-aggregation with type `rollupLambda`, specify rollups you would like to use
with `rollups` property, and finally set `unionWithSourceData: true` to use
source data as a real-time layer.

Please make sure that the lambda pre-aggregation definition comes first when
defining your pre-aggregations.

```javascript
cube('Users', {
  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    lambda: {
      type: `rollupLambda`,
      unionWithSourceData: true,
      rollups: [Users.batch]
    },
    batch: {
      measures: [Users.count],
      dimensions: [Users.name],
      timeDimension: Users.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      buildRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT '2020-01-01'`
      },
      buildRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT '2022-05-30'`
      }
    }
  },
})
```

### Batch and streaming data

In this scenario, batch data is comes from one pre-aggregation and real-time
data comes from a [streaming pre-aggregation][streaming-pre-agg].

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Lambda pre-aggregation batch and streaming diagram"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Caching/lambda-batch-streaming.png"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

You can use lambda pre-aggregations to combine data from multiple
pre-aggregation, where one pre-aggregation can have batch data and another
streaming.

```javascript
// This cube uses a streaming SQL data source such as ksqlDB
cube('StreamingUsers', {
  ...,
  dataSource: 'ksql',
  
  preAggregations: {
    streaming: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measures: [StreamingUsers.count],
      dimensions: [StreamingUsers.name],
      timeDimension: StreamingUsers.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
    }
  }
});

// This cube uses a data source such as Clickhouse or BigQuery
cube('Users', {
  ...,
  preAggregations: {
    batchStreamingLambda: {
      type: `rollupLambda`,
      rollups: [Users.batch, StreamingUsers.streaming]
    },
    batch: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measures: [Users.count],
      dimensions: [Users.name],
      timeDimension: Users.createdAt,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      buildRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT '2020-01-01'`
      },
      buildRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT '2022-05-30'`
      }
    },
    
  },
)
```
