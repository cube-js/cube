Pre-aggregations is a powerful way to speed up your Cube.js queries. There are many
configuration options to consider. Please make sure to also check [this
Pre-Aggregations page in the data schema section](/pre-aggregations).

## Refresh Strategy

Refresh strategy can be customized by setting the
[refreshKey](/pre-aggregations#refresh-key) property for the pre-aggregation.

The default value of `refreshKey` is `every: '1 hour'`. It can be redefined
either by providing SQL:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    amountByCreated: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [amount],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `month`,
      refreshKey: {
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Or by providing a refresh time interval:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    amountByCreated: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [amount],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `month`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `12 hour`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Background Refresh

You can refresh pre-aggregations in the background by setting
`scheduledRefresh: true`.

In development mode, Cube.js enables background refresh by default and will
refresh all pre-aggregations marked with the
[`scheduledRefresh`](/pre-aggregations#scheduled-refresh) parameter.

Please consult the [Production Checklist][link-production-checklist-refresh] for
best practices on running background refresh in production environments.

```js
cube(`Orders`, {
  // ...

  preAggregations: {
    amountByCreated: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measureReferences: [amount],
      timeDimensionReference: createdAt,
      granularity: `month`,
      scheduledRefresh: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## Pre-Aggregations Storage

When using **external** pre-aggregations, Cube.js will
store pre-aggregations inside its own purpose-built storage layer: Cube Store.

Alternatively, you can store external pre-aggregations in a different database, such MySQL or Postgres.
In order to make this work, you should set the
[`externalDriverFactory`][ref-config-extdriverfactory] and
[`externalDbType`][ref-config-extdbtype] properties in your `cube.js`
configuration file. These properties can also be set through the environment
variables.

[ref-config-extdbtype]: /config#options-reference-external-db-type
[ref-config-extdriverfactory]: /config#options-reference-external-driver-factory
[link-production-checklist-refresh]: /deployment/production-checklist#set-up-refresh-worker

```bash
CUBEJS_EXT_DB_HOST=<YOUR_DB_HOST_HERE>
CUBEJS_EXT_DB_PORT=<YOUR_DB_PORT_HERE>
CUBEJS_EXT_DB_NAME=<YOUR_DB_NAME_HERE>
CUBEJS_EXT_DB_USER=<YOUR_DB_USER_HERE>
CUBEJS_EXT_DB_PASS=<YOUR_DB_PASS_HERE>
CUBEJS_EXT_DB_TYPE=<SUPPORTED_DB_TYPE_HERE>
```
