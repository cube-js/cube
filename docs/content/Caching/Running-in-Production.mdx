Cube.js makes use of two different kinds of cache:

- Redis, for in-memory storage of query results
- Cube Store for storing pre-aggregations

In development, Cube.js uses in-memory storage on the server. In production, we
**strongly** recommend running Redis as a separate service.

<WarningBox>

Cube Store [will replace
Redis][replace-redis] for in-memory cache and queue management in late
2022.

</WarningBox>

Cube Store is enabled by default when running Cube.js in development mode. In
production, Cube Store **must** run as a separate process. The easiest way to do
this is to use the official Docker images for Cube.js and Cube Store.

<InfoBox>

Using Windows? We **strongly** recommend using [WSL2 for Windows 10][link-wsl2]
to run the following commands.

</InfoBox>

You can run Cube Store with Docker with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3030:3030 cubejs/cubestore
```

<InfoBox>

Cube Store can further be configured via environment variables. To see a
complete reference, please consult the [Cube Store section of the Environment
Variables reference][ref-config-env].

</InfoBox>

Next, run Cube.js and tell it to connect to Cube Store running on `localhost`
(on the default port `3030`):

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -e CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST=localhost \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  cubejs/cube
```

In the command above, we're specifying `CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST` to let Cube.js
know where Cube Store is running.

You can also use Docker Compose to achieve the same:

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  cubestore:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data

  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    environment:
      - CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST=localhost
    depends_on:
      - cubestore
    links:
      - cubestore
    volumes:
      - ./schema:/cube/conf/schema
```

## Scaling

<WarningBox>

Cube Store _can_ be run in a single instance mode, but this is usually
unsuitable for production deployments. For high concurrency and data throughput,
we **strongly** recommend running Cube Store as a cluster of multiple instances
instead.

</WarningBox>

Scaling Cube Store for a higher concurrency is relatively simple when running in
cluster mode. Because [the storage layer](#storage) is decoupled from the query
processing engine, you can horizontally scale your Cube Store cluster for as
much concurrency as you require.

In cluster mode, Cube Store runs two kinds of nodes:

- a single **router** node handles incoming client connections, manages database
  metadata and serves simple queries.
- multiple **worker** nodes which execute SQL queries

The configuration required for each node can be found in the table below. More
information about these variables can be found [in the Environment Variables
reference][ref-config-env].

| Environment Variable    | Specify on Router? | Specify on Worker? |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME` | Yes                | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_META_PORT`   | Yes                | -                  |
| `CUBESTORE_WORKERS`     | Yes                | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT` | -                  | Yes                |
| `CUBESTORE_META_ADDR`   | -                  | Yes                |

`CUBESTORE_WORKERS` and `CUBESTORE_META_ADDR` variables should be set with stable addresses, which should not change.
You can use stable DNS names and put load balancers in front of your worker and router instances to fulfill stable name requirements in environments where stable IP addresses can't be guaranteed.
Please note that instances behind load balancer can't be replicated, and replication will lead to undefined behavior of cluster, including connection errors and data loss.
If Cube Store replication is a requirement, please consider using Cube Cloud.

<InfoBox>

To fully take advantage of the worker nodes in the cluster, we **strongly**
recommend using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning].

</InfoBox>

A sample Docker Compose stack for the single machine setting this up might look like:

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  cubestore_router:
    restart: always
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_META_PORT=9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001,cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
  cubestore_worker_1:
    restart: always
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=9001
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001,cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
  cubestore_worker_2:
    restart: always
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=9001
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001,cubestore_worker_2:9001
      - CUBESTORE_REMOTE_DIR=/cube/data
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
    volumes:
      - .cubestore:/cube/data
  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    environment:
      - CUBEJS_CUBESTORE_HOST=cubestore_router
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
    volumes:
      - .:/cube/conf
```

## Storage

<WarningBox>

Cube Store can only use one type of remote storage at runtime.

</WarningBox>

Cube Store makes use of a separate storage layer for storing metadata as well as
for persisting pre-aggregations as Parquet files. Cube Store [can be configured
to use either AWS S3 or Google Cloud][ref-config-env-cloud-storage]. 
If desired, local path on the server can also be used in case all Cube Store cluster nodes are co-located on a single machine.

<WarningBox>

Cube Store requires strong consistency guarantees from underlying distributed storage.
AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage (Cube Cloud only) are the only known implementations that provide strong consistency.
Using other implementations in production is discouraged and can lead to consistency and data corruption errors.

</WarningBox>

A simplified example using AWS S3 might look like:

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  cubestore_router:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_META_PORT=9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_S3_BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_S3_REGION=<BUCKET_REGION_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
  cubestore_worker_1:
    image: cubejs/cubestore:latest
    environment:
      - CUBESTORE_SERVER_NAME=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_WORKER_PORT=9001
      - CUBESTORE_META_ADDR=cubestore_router:9999
      - CUBESTORE_WORKERS=cubestore_worker_1:9001
      - CUBESTORE_S3_BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_S3_REGION=<BUCKET_REGION_IN_S3>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
      - CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    depends_on:
      - cubestore_router
```

### Local Storage

Separately from remote storage, Cube Store requires local scratch space to warm up partitions by downloading Parquet files before querying them.
By default, this directory should be mounted to `.cubestore/data` dir inside contained and can be configured by [CUBESTORE_DATA_DIR][ref-config-env] environment variable.
It is advised to use local SSDs for this scratch space to maximize querying performance.

### <--{"id" : "Storage"}--> AWS

Cube Store can retrieve security credentials from instance metadata
automatically. This means you can skip defining the
`CUBESTORE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `CUBESTORE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment
variables.

<WarningBox>

Cube Store currently does not take the key expiration time returned from
instance metadata into account; instead the refresh duration for the key is
defined by `CUBESTORE_AWS_CREDS_REFRESH_EVERY_MINS`, which is set to `180` by
default.

</WarningBox>

## Security

Cube Store currently does not have any in-built authentication mechanisms. For
this reason, we recommend running your Cube Store cluster on a network that only
allows requests from the Cube.js deployment.
