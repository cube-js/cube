Often at the beginning of an analytical application's lifecycle - when there is
a smaller dataset that queries execute over - the application works well and
delivers responses within acceptable thresholds. However, as the size of the
dataset grows, the time-to-response from a user's perspective can often suffer
quite heavily. This is true of both application and purpose-built data
warehousing solutions.

This leaves us with a chicken-and-egg problem; application databases can deliver
low-latency responses with small-to-large datasets, but struggle with massive
analytical datasets; data warehousing solutions _usually_ make no guarantees
except to deliver a response, which means latency can vary wildly on a
query-to-query basis.

| Database Type                  | Low Latency? | Massive Datasets? |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Application (Postgres/MySQL)   | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå                |
| Analytical (BigQuery/Redshift) | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ                |

Cube.js provides a solution to this problem: pre-aggregations. In layman's
terms, a pre-aggregation is a condensed version of the source data. It specifies
attributes from the source, which Cube.js uses to condense (or crunch) the data.
This simple yet powerful optimization can reduce the size of the dataset by
several orders of magnitude, and ensures subsequent queries can be served by the
same condensed dataset if any matching attributes are found.

[Pre-aggregations are defined within each cube's data
schema][ref-schema-preaggs], and cubes can have as many pre-aggregations as they
require. The pre-aggregated data [can be stored either alongside the source data
in the same database, in an external database][ref-caching-preaggs-storage] that
is supported by Cube.js, [or in Cube Store, a dedicated pre-aggregation storage
layer][ref-caching-preaggs-cubestore].

## Pre-Aggregations without Time Dimension

To illustrate pre-aggregations with an example, let's use a sample e-commerce
database. We have a schema representing all our `Orders`:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
      drillMembers: [id, createdAt],
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    completedAt: {
      sql: `completed_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

Some sample data from this table might look like:

| **id** | **status** | **completed_at**        |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 1      | completed  | 2021-02-15T12:21:11.290 |
| 2      | completed  | 2021-02-25T18:15:12.369 |
| 3      | shipped    | 2021-03-15T20:40:57.404 |
| 4      | processing | 2021-03-13T10:30:21.360 |
| 5      | completed  | 2021-03-10T18:25:32.109 |

Our first requirement is to populate a dropdown in our front-end application
which shows all possible statuses. The Cube.js query to retrieve this
information might look something like:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["Orders.status"]
}
```

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  // Same content as before, but including the following:
  preAggregations: {
    orderStatuses: {
      dimensions: [status],
    },
  },
});
```

## Pre-Aggregations with Time Dimension

Using the same schema as before, we are now finding that users frequently query
for the number of orders completed per day, and that this query is performing
poorly. This query might look something like:

```json
{
  "measures": ["Orders.count"],
  "timeDimensions": ["Orders.completedAt"]
}
```

In order to improve the performance of this query, we can add another
pre-aggregation definition to the `Orders` schema:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  // Same content as before, but including the following:
  preAggregations: {
    ordersByCompletedAt: {
      measures: [count],
      timeDimension: completedAt,
      granularity: `month`,
    },
  },
});
```

Note that we have added a `granularity` property with a value of `month` to this
definition. This allows Cube.js to aggregate the dataset to a single entry for
each month.

The next time the API receives the same JSON query, Cube.js will build (if it
doesn't already exist) the pre-aggregated dataset, store it in the source
database server and use that dataset for any subsequent queries. A sample of the
data in this pre-aggregated dataset might look like:

| **completed_at**        | **count** |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| 2021-02-01T00:00:00.000 | 2         |
| 2021-03-01T00:00:00.000 | 3         |

## Keeping pre-aggregations up-to-date

Pre-aggregations can become out-of-date or out-of-sync if the original dataset
changes. [Cube.js uses a refresh key to check the freshness of the
data][ref-caching-preaggs-refresh]; if a change in the refresh key is detected,
the pre-aggregations are rebuilt. These refreshes are performed in the
background as a scheduled process, unless configured otherwise.

## Ensuring pre-aggregations are targeted by queries

Cube.js selects the best available pre-aggregation based on the incoming queries
it receives via the API. The process for selection is summarized below:

1. Are all measures of type `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max` or
   `countDistinctApprox`?

2. If yes, then check if

   - The pre-aggregation contains all dimensions, filter dimensions and leaf
     measures from the query
   - The measures aren't multiplied ([via a `hasMany`
     relation][ref-schema-joins-hasmany])

3. If no, then check if

   - The query's time dimension granularity is set
   - All query filter dimensions are included in query dimensions
   - The pre-aggregation defines the **exact** set of dimensions and measures
     used in the query

You can find a complete flowchart [here][self-select-pre-agg].

### <--{"id" : "Ensuring pre-aggregations are targeted by queries"}--> Additivity

So far, we've described pre-aggregations as aggregated versions of your existing
data. However, there are some rules that apply when Cube.js uses the
pre-aggregation. The **additivity** of fields specified in both the query and in
the pre-aggregation determines this.

So what is additivity? Let's add another cube called `LineItems` to the previous
example to demonstrate. The `LineItems` **belong to** the `Orders` cube, and are
[joined][ref-schema-joins] as such:

```javascript
cube(`LineItems`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.line_items`,

  joins: {
    Orders: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.order_id = ${Orders}.id`,
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
      drillMembers: [id, createdAt],
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    createdAt: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

Some sample data from the `line_items` table might look like:

| **id** | **product_id** | **order_id** | **quantity** | **price** | **profit_margin** | **created_at**             |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1      | 31             | 1            | 1            | 275       | 1                 | 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 |
| 2      | 49             | 2            | 6            | 248       | 0.1               | 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 |
| 3      | 89             | 3            | 6            | 197       | 0.35              | 2021-01-21 00:00:00.000000 |
| 4      | 71             | 4            | 8            | 223       | 0.15              | 2021-01-21 00:00:00.000000 |
| 5      | 64             | 5            | 5            | 75        | 0.75              | 2021-01-22 00:00:00.000000 |
| 6      | 62             | 6            | 8            | 75        | 0.65              | 2021-01-22 00:00:00.000000 |

Looking at the raw data, we can see that if the data were to be aggregated by
`created_at`, then we could simply add together the `quantity` and `price`
fields and still get a correct result:

| **created_at**             | **quantity** | **price** |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 | 7            | 523       |
| 2021-01-21 00:00:00.000000 | 14           | 420       |
| 2021-01-22 00:00:00.000000 | 13           | 150       |

This means that `quantity` and `price` are both **additive measures**, and we
can represent them in the `LineItems` schema as follows:

```javascript
cube(`LineItems`, {
  ...,
  measures: {
    ...,
    quantity: {
      sql: `quantity`,
      type: `sum`,
    },
    price: {
      type: `sum`,
      sql: `price`,
      format: `currency`,
    },
  },
  ...,
});
```

Because neither `quantity` and `price` reference any other measures in our
`LineItems` cube, we can also say that they are **additive leaf measures**. Any
query requesting only these two measures can be called a **leaf measure
additive** query. Additive leaf measures can only be of the following
[types][ref-schema-types-measure]: `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max` or
`countDistinctApprox`.

[ref-schema-types-measure]: /types-and-formats#measures-types

### <--{"id" : "Ensuring pre-aggregations are targeted by queries"}--> Non-Additivity

Using the same sample data for `line_items`, there's a `profit_margin` field
which is different for each row. However, despite the value being numerical, it
doesn't actually make sense to add up this value. Let's look at the rows for
`2021-01-20` in the sample data:

| **id** | **product_id** | **order_id** | **quantity** | **price** | **profit_margin** | **created_at**             |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1      | 31             | 1            | 1            | 275       | 1                 | 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 |
| 2      | 49             | 2            | 6            | 248       | 0.1               | 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 |

And now let's try and aggregate them:

| **created_at**             | **quantity** | **price** | **profit_margin** |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 | 7            | 523       | 1.1               |

Using the source data, we'll manually calculate the profit margin and see if it
matches the above. We'll use the following formula:

$$
x + (x * y) = z
$$

Where `x` is the original cost of the item, `y` is the profit margin and `z` is
the price the item was sold for. Let's use the formula to find the original cost
for both items sold on `2021-01-20`. For the row with `id = 1`:

$$
x + (x * 1) = 275\\
2x = 275\\
x = 275 / 2\\
x = 137.5
$$

And for the row where `id = 2`:

$$
x + (x * 0.1) = 248\\
1.1x = 248\\
x = 248 / 1.1\\
x = 225.454545454545455
$$

Which means the total cost for both items was:

$$
225.454545454545455 + 137.5\\
362.954545454545455
$$

Now that we have the cost of each item, let's use the same formula in reverse to
see if applying a profit margin of `1.1` will give us the same total price
(`523`) as calculated earlier:

$$
362.954545454545455 + (362.954545454545455 * 1.1) = z\\
762.204545454545455 = z\\
z = 762.204545454545455
$$

We can clearly see that `523` **does not** equal `762.204545454545455`, and we
cannot treat the `profit_margin` column the same as we would any other additive
measure. Armed with the above knowledge, we can add the `profit_margin` field to
our schema **as a [dimension][ref-schema-dims]**:

```javascript
cube(`LineItems`, {
  ...,
  dimensions: {
    ...,
    profitMargin: {
      sql: `profit_margin`,
      type: `number`,
      format: 'percentage',
    },
  },
  ...,
});
```

Another approach might be to calculate the profit margin dynamically, and
instead saving the "cost" price. Because the cost price is an additive measure,
we are able to store it in a pre-aggregation:

```javascript
cube(`LineItems`, {
  ...,
  measures: {
    ...,
    cost: {
      sql: `${CUBE.price} / (1 + ${CUBE.profitMargin})`,
      type: `sum`,
    },
  },
  ...,
});
```

Another example of a non-additive measure would be a distinct count of
`product_id`. If we took the distinct count of products sold over a month, and
then tried to sum the distinct count of products for each individual day and
compared them, we would not get the same results. We can add the measure like
this:

```javascript
cube(`LineItems`, {
  ...,
  measures: {
    ...,
    countDistinctProducts: {
      sql: `product_id`,
      type: `countDistinct`,
    },
  },
  ...,
});
```

However the above cannot be used in for a pre-aggregation. We can instead change
the `type` to `countDistinctApprox`, and then use the measure in a
pre-aggregation definition:

```javascript
cube(`LineItems`, {
  ...,
  measures: {
    ...,
    countDistinctProducts: {
      sql: `product_id`,
      type: `countDistinctApprox`,
    },
  },
  preAggregations: {
    myRollup: {
      ...,
      measures: [ CUBE.countDistinctProducts ],
    }
  },
  ...,
});
```

### <--{"id" : "Ensuring pre-aggregations are targeted by queries"}--> Selecting the pre-aggregation

To recap what we've learnt so far:

- **Additive measures** are measures whose values can be added together

- **Multiplied measures** are measures that define `hasMany` relations

- **Leaf measures** are measures that do not reference any other measures in
  their definition

- **Calculated measures** are measures that reference other dimensions and
  measures in their definition

- A query is **leaf measure additive** if all of its leaf measures are one of:
  `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max` or `countDistinctApprox`

Cube looks for matching pre-aggregations in the order they are defined in a
cube's schema file. Each defined pre-aggregation is then tested for a match
based on the criteria in the flowchart below:

<div
  style="text-align: center"

  <img
  alt="Pre-Aggregation Selection Flowchart"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/Caching/pre-agg-selection-flow.png"
  style="border: none"
  width="100%"
  />
</div>

Some extra considerations for pre-aggregation selection:

- The query's time dimension and granularity must match the pre-aggregation.

- The query's time dimension and granularity together act as a dimension. If the
  date range isn't aligned with granularity, a common granularity is used. This
  common granularity is selected using the [greatest common divisor][wiki-gcd]
  across both the query and pre-aggregation. For example, the common granularity
  between `hour` and `day` is `hour` because both `hour` and `day` can be
  divided by `hour`.

- The query's granularity's date range must match the start date and end date
  from the time dimensions. For example, when using a granularity of `month`,
  the values should be the start and end days of the month i.e.
  `['2020-01-01T00:00:00.000', '2020-01-31T23:59:59.999']`; when the granularity
  is `day`, the values should be the start and end hours of the day i.e.
  `['2020-01-01T00:00:00.000', '2020-01-01T23:59:59.999']`. Date ranges are
  inclusive, and the minimum granularity is `second`.

- The order in which pre-aggregations are defined in schemas matter; the first
  matching pre-aggregation for a query is the one that is used. Both the
  measures and dimensions of any cubes specified in the query are checked to
  find a matching `rollup`.

- `rollup` pre-aggregations **always** have priority over `originalSql`. Thus,
  if you have both `originalSql` and `rollup` defined, Cube.js will try to match
  `rollup` pre-aggregations before trying to match `originalSql`. You can
  instruct Cube.js to use the original SQL pre-aggregations by using
  [`useOriginalSqlPreAggregations`][ref-schema-preaggs-origsql].
