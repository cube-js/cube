Pre-aggregations is a powerful way to speed up your Cube queries. There are many
configuration options to consider. Please make sure to also check [the
Pre-Aggregations reference in the data schema section][ref-schema-ref-preaggs].

## Refresh Strategy

Refresh strategy can be customized by setting the
[`refreshKey`][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refresh-key] property for the
pre-aggregation.

The default value of [`refreshKey`][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refresh-key] is
`every: '1 hour'`. It can be redefined either by overriding the default value of
the [`every` property][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refresh-key-every]:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    amount_by_created: {
      type: `rollup`,
      measures: [amount],
      timeDimension: created_at,
      granularity: `month`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `12 hour`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Or by providing a [`sql` property][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refresh-key-sql]
instead, and leaving `every` unchanged from its' default value:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    amount_by_created: {
      measures: [amount],
      timeDimension: created_at,
      granularity: `month`,
      refreshKey: {
        // every will default to `10 seconds` here
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Or both `every` and `sql` can be defined together:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    amount_by_created: {
      measures: [amount],
      timeDimension: created_at,
      granularity: `month`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `12 hour`,
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

When `every` and `sql` are used together, Cube will run the query from the `sql`
property on an interval defined by the `every` property. If the query returns
new results, then the pre-aggregation will be refreshed.

## Rollup Only Mode

To make Cube _only_ serve requests from pre-aggregations, the
[`CUBEJS_ROLLUP_ONLY`][ref-config-env-rolluponly] environment variable can be
set to `true` on an API instance. This will prevent serving data on API requests
from the source database.

<WarningBox>

When using this configuration in a single node deployment (where the API
instance and [Refresh Worker][ref-deploy-refresh-wrkr] are configured on the
same host), requests made to the API that cannot be satisfied by a rollup throw
an error. Scheduled refreshes will continue to work in the background.

</WarningBox>

## Partitioning

[Partitioning][wiki-partitioning] is an extremely effective optimization for
accelerating pre-aggregations build and refresh time. It effectively "shards"
the data between multiple tables, splitting them by a defined attribute. Cube
can be configured to incrementally refresh only the last set of partitions
through the `updateWindow` property. This leads to faster refresh times due to
unnecessary data not being reloaded, and even reduced cost for some databases
like [BigQuery](/config/databases/google-bigquery) or
[AWS Athena](/config/databases/aws-athena).

Any `rollup` pre-aggregation can be partitioned by time using the
`partitionGranularity` property in [a pre-aggregation
definition][ref-schema-ref-preaggs]. In the example below, the
`partitionGranularity` is set to `month`, which means Cube will generate
separate tables for each month's worth of data. Once built, it will continue to
refresh on a daily basis the last 3 months of data.

```typescript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `select * from orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    category_and_date: {
      measures: [Orders.count, revenue],
      dimensions: [category],
      timeDimension: created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partitionGranularity: `month`,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
        updateWindow: `3 months`
      }
    },
  },
});
```

## Using Indexes

### When to use indexes?

Indexes are great when you filter large amounts of data across one or several
dimension columns. You can read more about them
[here][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-index].

### Best Practices

To maximize performance, you can introduce an index per type of query so the set
of dimensions used in the query overlap as much as possible with the ones
defined in the index. Measures are traditionally only used in indexes if you
plan to filter a measured value and the cardinality of the possible values of
the measure is low.

The order in which columns are specified in the index is **very** important;
suboptimal ordering can lead to diminished performance. To improve the
performance of an index the main thing to consider is the order of the columns
defined in it. The order of the columns should be defined in accordance with the
[Index Selectivity](https://blog.toadworld.com/2018/09/05/unselective-indexes-selectivity).
In a nutshell, index selectivity measures how many unique values a database has.
An index is said to have a **higher** selectivity as the number of unique values
goes up and a **lower** selectivity as the number of unique values goes down.
Once we know the selectivity of the columns we'll be adding to the index, we
need to place them from **lowest** to **highest** selectivity (this is probably
contrary to what you've read about the topic in traditional row-based
databases).

**Example:**

Suppose you have a pre-aggregation that has millions of rows with the following
structure:

| timestamp           | product_name  | product_category | zip_code | order_total |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 2023-01-01 10:00:00 | Plastic Chair | Furniture        | 88523    | 2000        |
| 2023-01-01 10:00:00 | Keyboard      | Electronics      | 88523    | 1000        |
| 2023-01-01 10:00:00 | Mouse         | Electronics      | 88523    | 800         |
| 2023-01-01 11:00:00 | Plastic Chair | Furniture        | 88524    | 3000        |
| 2023-01-01 11:00:00 | Keyboard      | Electronics      | 88524    | 2000        |

The pre-aggregation code would look as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM Orders`,
  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.order_total],
      dimensions: [CUBE.product_name, CUBE.product_category, CUBE.zip_code],
      timeDimension: CUBE.timestamp,
      granularity: `hour`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch: true,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 hour`,
        updateWindow: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
      },
      buildRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT date_sub(NOW(), 365)`,
      },
      buildRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures: [CUBE.order_total]
        dimensions: [CUBE.product_name, CUBE.product_category, CUBE.zip_code]
        time_dimension: CUBE.timestamp
        granularity: hour
        partition_granularity: day
        allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch: true
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 hour
          update_window: 1 day
          incremental: true
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT date_sub(NOW(), 365)
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT NOW()
```

</CodeTabs>

You run the following query on a regular basis, with the only difference between
queries being the filter values:

```JSON
{
  "measures": [
    "Orders.order_total"
  ],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Orders.timestamp",
      "granularity": "hour",
      "dateRange": [
        "2022-12-14T06:00:00.000",
        "2023-01-13T06:00:00.000"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    [
      "Orders.timestamp",
      "asc"
    ]
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "member": "Orders.product_category",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": [
        "Electronics"
      ]
    },
    {
      "member": "Orders.product_name",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": [
        "Keyboard",
        "Mouse"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dimensions": [
    "Orders.zip_code"
  ],
  "limit": 10000
}
```

After running this on a dataset with millions of records you find that it's
taking a long time to run, so you decide to add an index to target this specific
query. Taking into account the best practices mentioned previously you should
define an index as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM Orders;`,
  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.order_total],
      dimensions: [CUBE.product_name, CUBE.product_category, CUBE.zip_code],
      timeDimension: CUBE.timestamp,
      granularity: `hour`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch: true,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 hour`,
        updateWindow: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
      },
      buildRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT date_sub(NOW(), 365)`,
      },
      buildRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
      // New Index
      indexes: {
        category_productname_zipcode_index: {
          columns: [CUBE.product_category, CUBE.product_name, CUBE.zip_code],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures: [CUBE.order_total]
        dimensions: [CUBE.product_name, CUBE.product_category, CUBE.zip_code]
        time_dimension: CUBE.timestamp
        granularity: hour
        partition_granularity: day
        allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch: true
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 hour
          update_window: 1 day
          incremental: true
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT date_sub(NOW(), 365)
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT NOW()
        # new index
        indexes:
          - name: category_productname_zipcode_index
            columns: [CUBE.product_category, CUBE.product_name, CUBE.zip_code]
```

</CodeTabs>

Then the data within `category_productname_zipcode_index` would look like:

| product_category | product_name  | zip_code | timestamp           | order_total |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Furniture        | Plastic Chair | 88523    | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 | 2000        |
| Electronics      | Keyboard      | 88523    | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 | 1000        |
| Electronics      | Mouse         | 88523    | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 | 800         |
| Furniture        | Plastic Chair | 88524    | 2023-01-01 11:00:00 | 3000        |
| Electronics      | Keyboard      | 88524    | 2023-01-01 11:00:00 | 2000        |

The columns are ordered from **lowest** to **highest** selectivity. We can
expect there to be a lower number of product categories, hence a lower number of
unique records resulting in a lower selectivity. Although `zip_code` may have
lower or higher selectivity, the dimensions used to filter must come first than
the dimensions in the GROUP BY part of the query.

### Aggregated indexes

Aggregated indexes be defined as well. You can read more about them
[here][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-index].

**Example:**

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM Orders;`,
  preAggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.order_total],
      dimensions: [CUBE.product_name, CUBE.product_category, CUBE.zip_code],
      timeDimension: CUBE.timestamp,
      granularity: `hour`,
      partitionGranularity: `day`,
      allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch: true,
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 hour`,
        updateWindow: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
      },
      buildRangeStart: {
        sql: `SELECT date_sub(NOW(), 365)`,
      },
      buildRangeEnd: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`,
      },
      indexes: {
        category_productname_zipcode_index: {
          columns: [CUBE.product_category, CUBE.product_name, CUBE.zip_code],
        },
        // New Index
        zip_code_index: {
          columns: [CUBE.zip_code],
          type: `aggregate`,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: Orders
    sql: SELECT * FROM orders
    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures: [CUBE.order_total]
        dimensions: [CUBE.product_name, CUBE.product_category, CUBE.zip_code]
        time_dimension: CUBE.timestamp
        granularity: hour
        partition_granularity: day
        allowNonStrictDateRangeMatch: true
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 hour
          update_window: 1 day
          incremental: true
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT date_sub(NOW(), 365)
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT NOW()
        indexes:
          - name: category_productname_zipcode_index
            columns: [CUBE.product_category, CUBE.product_name, CUBE.zip_code]
          # new index
          - name: zip_code_index
            columns: [CUBE.zip_code]
            type: aggregate
```

</CodeTabs>

And the data for `zip_code_index` would look like the following:

| zip_code | order_total |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 88523    | 3800        |
| 88524    | 5000        |

## Inspecting Pre-Aggregations

Cube Store partially supports the MySQL protocol. This allows you to execute
simple queries using a familiar SQL syntax. You can connect using the MySQL CLI
client, for example:

```bash{promptUser: user}
mysql -h <CUBESTORE_IP> --user=cubestore -pcubestore
```

<WarningBox>

Only Linux and Mac OS versions of MySQL client are supported as of right now.
You can install one on ubuntu using `apt-get install default-mysql-client`
command or `brew install mysql-client` on Mac OS. Windows versions of the MySQL
client aren't supported.

</WarningBox>

To check which pre-aggregations are managed by Cube Store, you could run the
following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| table_schema         | table_name                                    |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| dev_pre_aggregations | orders_main20190101_23jnqarg_uiyfxd0f_1gifflf |
| dev_pre_aggregations | orders_main20190301_24ph0a1c_utzntnv_1gifflf  |
| dev_pre_aggregations | orders_main20190201_zhrh5kj1_rkmsrffi_1gifflf |
| dev_pre_aggregations | orders_main20191001_mdw2hxku_waxajvwc_1gifflf |
| dev_pre_aggregations | orders_main20190701_izc2tl0h_bxsf1zlb_1gifflf |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

These pre-aggregations are stored as Parquet files under the `.cubestore/`
folder in the project root during development.

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting Pre-Aggregations"}--> EXPLAIN queries

Cube Store's MySQL protocol also supports `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
queries both of which are useful for determining how much processing a query
will require.

`EXPLAIN` queries show the logical plan for a query:

```sql
 EXPLAIN SELECT orders__platform, orders__gender, sum(orders__count) FROM dev_pre_aggregations.orders_general_o32v4dvq_vbyemtl2_1h5hs8r
 GROUP BY orders__gender, orders__platform;
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| logical plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

  Aggregate
    ClusterSend, indices: [[96]]
      Scan dev_pre_aggregations.orders_general_o32v4dvq_vbyemtl2_1h5hs8r, source: CubeTable(index: orders_general_plat_gender_o32v4dvq_vbyemtl2_1h5hs8r:96:[123, 126]), fields: [orders__gender, orders__platform, orders__count] |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` queries show the physical plan for the router and all workers
used for query processing:

```sql
 EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT orders__platform, orders__gender, sum(orders__count) FROM dev_pre_aggregations.orders_general_o32v4dvq_vbyemtl2_1h5hs8r
 GROUP BY orders__gender, orders__platform

## Pre-Aggregations Storage

The default pre-aggregations storage in Cube is its own purpose-built storage
layer: Cube Store.

Alternatively, you can store pre-aggregations **internally** in the source
database. To store a pre-aggregation internally, set `external: false` in
pre-aggregation definition.

Please note, that [originalSql][ref-original-sql] pre-aggregations are stored
**internally** by default. It is not recommended to store `originalSql`
pre-aggregations in Cube Store.

## Joins between pre-aggregations

<WarningBox>

This feature is in Preview and the API may change in a future release. Joining
pre-aggregations **only** works with databases of the same type, support for
joining pre-aggregations from different databases is coming soon.

</WarningBox>

When making a query that joins data from two different cubes, Cube can use
pre-aggregations instead of running the base SQL queries. To get started, first
ensure both cubes have valid pre-aggregations:

```javascript
// Orders
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.orders`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    orders_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.user_id, CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
    },
  },

  joins: {
    Users: {
      sql: `${CUBE.user_id} = ${Users.id}`,
      relationship: `belongsTo`
    },
  },
});

// Users
cube(`Users`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.users`,

  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.id, CUBE.name],
    },
  },
});
```

Before we continue, let's add an index to the `orders_rollup` pre-aggregation so
that the `rollupJoin` pre-aggregation can work correctly:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    orders_rollup: {
      ...,
      indexes: {
        userIndex: {
          columns: [CUBE.user_id],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Now we can add a new pre-aggregation of type `rollupJoin` to the `Orders` cube:

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  ...,

  preAggregations: {
    orders_with_users_rollup: {
      type: `rollupJoin`,
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [Users.name],
      timeDimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      rollups: [Users.users_rollup, CUBE.orders_rollup],
    },
  },
});
```

With all of the above set up, making a query such as the following will now use
`Orders.orders_rollup` and `Users.users_rollup`, avoiding a database request:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["Users.name"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Orders.created_at",
      "dateRange": "This month"
    }
  ],
  "order": {
    "Orders.count": "desc"
  },
  "measures": ["Orders.count"]
}
```

## Pre-Aggregation Build Strategies

<InfoBox>

For ideal performance, pre-aggregations should be built using a dedicated
Refresh Worker. [See here for more details][ref-prod-list-refresh].

</InfoBox>

Cube supports three different strategies for building pre-aggregations. To see
which strategies your database supports, please refer to its individual page
from [Connecting to the Database][ref-config-db].

### <--{"id" : "Pre-Aggregation Build Strategies"}--> Simple

When using the simple strategy, Cube will use the source database as a temporary
staging area for writing pre-aggregations to determine column types. The data is
loaded back into memory before writing them to Cube Store (or an external
database).

<InfoBox>

For larger datasets, we strongly recommend using the [Batching][self-batching]
or [Export Bucket][self-export-bucket] strategies instead.

</InfoBox>

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

### <--{"id" : "Pre-Aggregation Build Strategies"}--> Batching

Batching is a more performant strategy where Cube sends compressed CSVs for Cube
Store to ingest.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Internal vs External vs External with Cube Store diagram"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/deb0194a-f7cb-49bc-84a6-d07bdeb8bd36/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

The performance scales to the amount of memory available on the Cube instance.
Batching is automatically enabled for any databases that can support it.

### <--{"id" : "Pre-Aggregation Build Strategies"}--> Export bucket

<WarningBox>

The export bucket strategy requires permission to execute `CREATE TABLE`
statements in the data source as part of the pre-aggregation build process.

</WarningBox>

When dealing with larger pre-aggregations (more than 100k rows), performance can
be significantly improved by using an export bucket. This allows the source
database to temporarily materialize the data locally, which is then loaded into
Cube Store in parallel:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    alt="Internal vs External vs External with Cube Store diagram"
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/f43999c4-cf91-4d36-9650-3078312fb9c9/"
    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

Enabling the export bucket functionality requires extra configuration; please
refer to the database-specific documentation for more details:

- [AWS Athena][ref-connect-db-athena]
- [AWS Redshift][ref-connect-db-redshift]
- [BigQuery][ref-connect-db-bigquery]
- [Snowflake][ref-connect-db-snowflake]

When using cloud storage, it is important to correctly configure any data
retention policies to clean up the data in the export bucket as Cube does not
currently manage this. For most use-cases, 1 day is sufficient.

## Streaming pre-aggregations

Streaming pre-aggregations are different from traditional pre-aggregations in
the way they are being updated. Traditional pre-aggregations follow the “pull”
model — Cube **pulls updates** from the data source based on some cadence and/or
condition. Streaming pre-aggregations follow the “push” model — Cube
**subscribes to the updates** from the data source and always keeps
pre-aggregation up to date.

You don’t need to define `refreshKey` for streaming pre-aggregations. Whether
pre-aggregation is streaming or not is defined by the data source.

Currently, Cube supports only one streaming data source -
[ksqlDB](/config/databases/ksqldb). All pre-aggregations where data source is
ksqlDB are streaming.

We are working on supporting more data sources for streaming pre-aggregations,
please [let us know](https://cube.dev/contact) if you are interested in early
access to any of these drivers or would like Cube to support any other SQL
streaming engine.
