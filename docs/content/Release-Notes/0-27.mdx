We're extremely proud to announce the release of Cube.js v0.27, coming hot on
the heels of our 103rd patch release ðŸ¥³

Cube.js v0.27 is a feature-rich, backwards-compatible, non-breaking release that
includes tons of improvements to security, authentication, caching, client
libraries, and the Developer Playground as well as some bug fixes.

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

None. Nada. Nothing. Natch ðŸ™… You can just update the dependency versions in
your project (either via Docker image or Node package version) and everything
will just work. That said, there is
[_one_ deprecation this release relating to Redis configuration options](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/blob/master/DEPRECATION.md#prefix-redis-environment-variables-with-cubejs_);
check the Deprecation document for more details.

## Authentication & Authorization

We've added support for JWK-based identity providers, allowing you to use
[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
with a tiny bit of configuration.

We've also added two new pages to our documentation detailing the above, and a
brand new in-depth guide to setting up
[Multi-Tenant Analytics with Auth0 and Cube.js](https://multi-tenant-analytics.cube.dev/).
If you'd like to see it in action, please watch the recording of our
[March Community Call](https://youtu.be/SycFPE4LRHo?t=2192).

## Cube Store is Generally Available

Cube Store is now shipped with Cube.js and now there's an
[official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cubejs/cubestore) for Cube
Store on Docker Hub. This is a huge milestone for us, and we're really excited
ðŸ˜€ To get started, you'll need to install the Cube Store driver and set your
external database to `cubestore`. If you prefer to see this feature in action,

[March's Community Call on YouTube](https://youtu.be/SycFPE4LRHo?t=1980).

## Vue Integration

The Vue integration for Cube.js now supports the `QueryBuilder` and
`QueryRenderer` components that effectively allows you to build your own Cube.js
[Developer Playground](https://cube.dev/docs/dev-tools/dev-playground) or
provide a similar experience to your users. This also brings our Vue integration
to parity with Angular and React, and we think it will be really helpful for
improving Cube.js adoption in the Vue community.

## Developer Playground

The Developer Playground has had a round of quality-of-life improvements; the
most notable being:

- The Security Context for queries can now be modified before making requests.
  This was a source of frustration for users who had security-context dependent
  schemas; prior to this there was no easy way to test these schemas in
  development mode.
- Invalid dimensions/measures are now clearly marked as such. This was often a
  minor pain point when developing schemas; invalid or out-of-date members would
  hang around and it wasn't often straightforward to tell whether they still
  existed or not.
- Queries are now prevented from automatically running, and now require you to
  click a button. This prevents sending any intermediate requests as a query is
  being built up, which in turn, reduces the load on the Cube.js API.
- Initial database configuration can now be done within the Developer
  Playground. Start a Cube.js project without any database configuration and
  upon first-boot, the Developer Playground will launch a connection wizard.
- Vue code snippets can now be generated, bringing it to parity with Angular and
  React.
- Vue-based charts can now be added to the Dynamic Dashboard, just like Angular
  and React.
