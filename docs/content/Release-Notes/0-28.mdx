We're extremely happy to announce Cube.js v0.28 ü•≥

Cube.js v0.28 includes tons of goodies for developers in the form of the
Developer Playground, not to mention incredible improvements to Cube Store and a
raft of reliability improvements to our database drivers.

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

Only one deprecation this release üî•

- Redis configuration variables are all now prefixed with `CUBEJS_`. This is
  part of an ongoing process to cleanly separate and mark environment variables
  used by Cube.js.

> Be sure to check the
> [Deprecation document](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/blob/master/DEPRECATION.md)
> for more details on the above.

## Server

- The `queryTransformer` property in the `cube.js` configuration file is
  replaced by `queryRewrite`

- A new environment variable `CUBEJS_REFRESH_WORKER` is introduced, which
  replaces `CUBEJS_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_TIMER`

- A new environment variable `CUBEJS_ROLLUP_ONLY` is introduced, which ensures
  all requests only target pre-aggregations of type `rollup` and that your
  database is not invoked

- Partition evaluation responsibilities have been moved from the schema compiler
  to the query orchestrator. This allows all time queries for partitioned
  rollups and fixes querying issues beyond a rollup's build range. This is also
  the first step towards rolling window rollups being supported üéâ

- Run timer refresh keys in Cube Store instead of your source database. This
  means the source database is now free of those pesky refresh SQL queries
  spamming the query log üòé
- The database connection wizard works in both Node and Docker-based installs

### Schema

- The default type for pre-aggregations is now
  [`rollup`](https://cube.dev/docs/pre-aggregations#rollup). This _can still_ be
  overridden by explicitly specifying the `type` property, but we strongly
  recommend using rollups instead of `originalSql` for most workloads.

- Pre-aggregation definitions now set the following as defaults:
  `external: true` and `scheduledRefresh: true`

- `refreshRangeStart`/`refreshRangeEnd` to be replaced by
  `buildRangeStart`/`buildRangeEnd`

- You can write
  `measureReferences`/`dimensionReferences`/`timeDimensionReference` as
  `measures`/`dimensions`/`timeDimension`.

### Drivers

We're working our way through the supported drivers so that Cube.js doesn't talk
to your database any more than is necessary. To this end, the following drivers
now default to
[`readOnly: true`](https://cube.dev/docs/caching/using-pre-aggregations#read-only-data-source)
automatically:

- ElasticSearch
- MySQL
- Postgres

### Pre-Aggregations

We've been cranking out improvements to pre-aggregations too, here are the
highlights:

- Cube Store is now the **default** storage for external pre-aggregations in new
  projects
- [Batching](https://cube.dev/docs/caching/using-pre-aggregations#optimizing-pre-aggregation-build-times-batching)
  is now also supported for
  - BigQuery
  - Clickhouse
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL (now in `readOnly: true` as well)
- [Export bucket](https://cube.dev/docs/caching/using-pre-aggregations#optimizing-pre-aggregation-build-times-export-bucket)
  is now also supported for
  - Redshift (on S3)
  - Snowflake (now on GCS as well as S3)

## Cube Store

- [Snowflake's HyperLogLog format](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/querying-approximate-cardinality.html)
  is now supported, which enables using
  [`countDistinctApprox`-type measures](https://cube.dev/docs/types-and-formats#measures-types-count-distinct-approx)
  in pre-aggregations
- Improved CSV ingestion time through distributed processing
- Now supports
  - `DATE_ADD`
  - `CONCAT`
  - `HAVING`
  - `COALESCE`
  - Decimal/float values

## Developer Playground

We have so many improvements here that we're really excited to share with you
all:

- You can now search for dimensions and measures. The members are also grouped
  by cube, which makes it easy-as-pie to pick out the ones you want.

- A long-requested item on our agenda has been Vue 3 support, which is now
  available.
- You can now have multiple tabs with their own queries in the Developer
  Playground - super useful when you want to keep queries at-hand without
  needing a separate instance of the Playground open

- The brand new Rollup Designer makes creating pre-aggregations an absolute
  treat.
