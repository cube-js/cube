Hi Cube Community üëã We're really excited to announce Cube v0.31 üéâ This new
release brings a number of major new features such as:

- Support for YAML modeling
- Support for ksqlDB
- Lambda pre-aggregations
- Views

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

Two breaking changes this release and 1 deprecation this release

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Foreign cube references must now reference a cube member
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `shown` property now hides cubes/views from the
  `/meta` endpoint when set to `true`
- **DEPRECATION**: The `driverFactory` property should return a `DriverConfig`
  object or a Promise that returns a `DriverConfig` object

> Be sure to check the
> [Deprecation document](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/blob/master/DEPRECATION.md)
> for more details on the above.

## Multiple Data Sources

Cube has had support for multiple data sources for quite some time now, but
we‚Äôve made it even easier to configure them now with environment variables.
[Read the documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/config/multiple-data-sources) to
see how it works.

## Modeling in YAML

We‚Äôve often heard users they want the ability to author data models in languages
other than JavaScript - specifically YAML and Python. Today, we‚Äôre excited to
release a public preview for YAML data modeling in Cube. Check out the
[introductory blog post](https://cube.dev/blog/introducing-cube-support-for-yaml-data-modeling),
or dive straight into
[the documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/getting-started/yaml).

## Views

Designed as a layer over cubes, views act as a fa√ßade of your whole data model.
They are a great tool for to defining metrics, managing governance and data
access, and controlling ambiguous join paths. Learn more about them in the
[introductory blog post](https://cube.dev/blog/introducing-views), read more
about them [in the documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/view)
or watch our in-depth
[webinar on the topic](https://cube.dev/events/using-cube-views-for-metrics-management).

## Lambda Pre-Aggregations

Lambda pre-aggregations allow combining batched/processed data with fresh data
at query time, this is super useful for real-time data applications. You can
even take it a step further and combine batched data from a data warehouse with
streaming data from ksqlDB; find more information
[in the documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/caching/pre-aggregations/lambda-pre-aggregations).

## Drivers

We‚Äôre really excited to present two new drivers,
[Firebolt](https://cube.dev/docs/config/databases/firebolt) and Trino. And to
top it off, we‚Äôve also added a brand-new driver for
[ksqlDB](https://cube.dev/docs/config/databases/ksqldb).

## SQL API

The Cube SQL API now speaks the Postgres protocol instead of MySQL; the Postgres
protocol is better supported and allows us to extend supports to dozens of
downstream tools. We‚Äôve also made a number of improvements relating syntax and
operator support, and we‚Äôve documented
[any difference in behaviour](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/sql/reference/functions-operators)
from regular SQL.

## Downstream Tools

We‚Äôve been busy since the last release adding support for downstream tools. Cube
now connects to:

- [Appsmith](https://cube.dev/docs/config/downstream/appsmith)
- [Tableau](https://cube.dev/docs/config/downstream/tableau/)
- [Microsoft PowerBI](https://cube.dev/docs/config/downstream/powerbi/)
- Thoughtspot
- Amazon QuickSight

Let us know if there‚Äôs a tool that you‚Äôd like supported by opening an issue on
GitHub.
