Hello Cube Community, we're really excited to announce Cube v0.32 üéâ

This new release brings the GraphQL API into general availability, adds a number
of quality-of-life improvements to Cube SQL and adds significant performance
boosts to Cube Store.

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

This release, we have **2** deprecations and **5** breaking changes:

> Be sure to check the
> [Deprecation document](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/blob/master/DEPRECATION.md)
> for more details.

### <--{"id" : "Breaking Changes and Deprecations"}--> Breaking Changes

- Support for Node.js v12 and v15 has been dropped due to [them reaching
  end-of-life][nodejs-eol]. We **strongly** recommend upgrading to Node.js v16.

- Absolute imports for the following packages have been removed. We now provide
  a public API from the package directly:

  - `@cubejs-backend/query-orchestrator`
  - `@cubejs-backend/schema-compiler`
  - `@cubejs-backend/server-core`

- Cube Store is now the default cache and queue engine, replacing Redis. We've
  talked previously about how [Cube Store will be replacing
  Redis][cube-blog-redis-deprecation], and this release makes it official üéâ

### <--{"id" : "Breaking Changes and Deprecations"}--> Deprecations

- Support for Node.js v14 has been marked as deprecated due to [it reaching
  end-of-life][nodejs-eol] in April 2023. We **strongly** recommend upgrading to
  Node.js v16.

- Using Cube with the Serverless Framework and the `@cubejs-backend/serverless`
  packages is now deprecated, we **strongly** recommend using [Docker-based
  deployments][cube-docs-deploy-docker] or [Cube Cloud][cube-docs-deploy-cloud]
  instead.

## Pre-aggregations

Following on from the [Lambda pre-aggregation][cube-docs-caching-lambda] support
introduced in our [last release][cube-docs-0-31], Cube now supports multiple
rollups from the same cube in a `rollupLambda` definition.

## CLI

The Cube CLI now lets you validate your models on your local machine - simply
run `npx cubejs-cli validate` to check the models in your project for errors:

```bash
$ npx cubejs-cli validate
‚ùå Cube Schema validation failed

Cube Error ---------------------------------------

Orders cube: "dimensions.id" does not match any of the allowed types
Possible reasons (one of):
	* (dimensions.id.case) is required
	* (dimensions.id.latitude) is required
	* (dimensions.id.sql) is required
LineItems cube: Cube Orders doesn't exist

## Drivers

We've enabled `readOnly: true` as the default for the
[Clickhouse][cube-docs-conf-clickhouse], [MSSQL][cube-docs-conf-mssql] and
[Oracle][cube-docs-conf-oracle] drivers which lets Cube build pre-aggregations
without creating temporary tables in those databases.

## GraphQL API

We're extremely excited to announce general availability of the GraphQL API in
Cube. With this, the GraphQL API now fully supports variables, a much-requested
(and much-needed) improvement:

```javascript
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

const getOrdersQuery = gql`
  query CubeQuery($orderBy: OrdersOrderByInput) {
    cube {
      orders(orderBy: $orderBy) {
        count
        status
      }
    }
  }
`;

const variables = {
  orderBy: {
    count: 'desc',
  },
};

client
  .query({
    query: getOrdersQuery,
    variables,
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## SQL API

Cube SQL continues to see quality-of-life improvements as well as enhanced
support for even more SQL functions as selections and projections. Some examples
of what we've improved this release include:

- Support for `CASE` statements in Cube projections
- Support for expressions like `NOT(LOWER() IN)`
- Allow using `CAST` in `HAVING` clauses
- Support for `LEFT` and `RIGHT` functions in projections
- Support for `NULLIF` in projections
- Allow using `TO_DATE()` in `DATE_DIFF()` expressions
- Allow using `DATE_TRUNC()` in `WHERE` clauses

We hope that you find these helpful in your work with Cube SQL; please let us
know if you have any feedback or suggestions by [opening
issues][cube-gh-issue-new] on our GitHub repository.
