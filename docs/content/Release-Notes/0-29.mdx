We're extremely happy to announce Cube v0.29 🥳

v0.29 includes tons of goodies for developers in the form of the Developer
Playground, not to mention incredible improvements to Cube Store and reliability
improvements to our database drivers.

What we're really excited to announce is two new capabilities:

- [SQL API](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/sql)
- [GraphQL API](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/graphql/getting-started)

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

- Remove Node.js 10.x support
- Remove Node.js 15.x support
- Deprecate Node.js 12.x
- The Docker images for Cube now use Node.js 14.x
- The Angular frontend integration now only supports Angular 12.x

## Server

- Cube Store now correctly shuts down when the Cube server exits
- Fixes an issue where a pre-aggregation may not be found after it was created
  by a Refresh Worker
- Add ability to pass through `generic-pool` options for Redis

### Cube SQL API

- Query your cubes with our new MySQL-compatible SQL API. This means you can now
  connect Cube to third-party BI tools. It launches with support for Superset;
  we're adding support for Metabase, Tableau, PowerBI and even Microsoft Excel.

### Query Format

- You can now specify date ranges such as `tomorrow` and `next 2 month` for a
  `dateRange`.

### Schema

- `refreshKey` now supports an `every` property
- A new `quarter` granularity is now available
- Support multi-value filtering on same column through `FILTER_PARAMS`
- Improve error messages on schema validation failure

### Drivers

- AWS Athena: The driver now uses AWS SDK v3, this reduces bundle sizes
  significantly for deployments using the Serverless Framework.
- AWS Athena: Use `getWorkGroup()` instead of `SELECT 1` to test connection
  health.
- AWS Athena: Allow configuring the workgroup via `CUBEJS_AWS_ATHENA_WORKGROUP`.
- BigQuery: Datasets that cannot be accessed with the current permissions are
  ignored.
- BigQuery: Improved type detection in read-only mode
- Oracle: You can now specify the port number with `CUBEJS_DB_PORT`.
- Oracle: Move `oracledb` to `optionalDependencies` to unblock developers using
  ARM64.
- MySQL: Handle data of type `utf8mb4_bin` as `string`.
- Postgres: Add support for pre-aggregating `countDistinctApprox` measures
- Postgres: Improved type detection in read-only mode
- PrestoDB: Support connections over SSL
- Snowflake: Fix error `ReferenceError: host is not defined`
- Snowflake: Do not trigger cluster start on test connection

### Pre-Aggregations

- All pre-aggregations now have a default `refreshKey` of 1 hour.
- Measures with a rolling window, including `countDistinctApprox` can now be
  pre-aggregated

## Frontend Integrations

### Core

- Data blending queries can now be made without a `dateRange`
- Time dimensions are now included under `dimensions` for cube metadata
- Prevent redundant authentication checks
- Preserve order of elements when calling `ResultSet.tableColumns()`
- Measures that return nullish (`undefined` or `null`) values are now converted
  to `0`

### Angular

- Angular 12 support
- Async client generation support in Angular
  ([Find an example here](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/tree/master/examples/dynamic-angular-dashboard))
- `FilterMember.replace()` no longer updates all filters with replacement

### React

- Introduce new `useCubeMeta()` hook

### Vue

- Correctly handle `dryRun` errors on component mount
- New `wrapWithQueryRenderer` prop to allow using the `QueryBuilder` component
  without the `QueryRenderer`

## Cube Store

Cube Store has seen a huge number of stability fixes and quality improvements;
far too many to mention here, but here's a summary:

- Improved Cube Store installation process
- Improved error handling for incorrect configuration
- Added support for `date_add` and `date_sub` SQL functions
- Added equality comparison between `bool` and `int` types
- We now build non-avx versions of Cube Store so you can use them on ARM64
  platforms
- `ILIKE` is now supported
- Added `CUBESTORE_META_BIND_ADDR` and `CUBESTORE_WORKER_BIND_ADDR` to allow for
  IPv6 binds
- Fix issue when using decimal types
- MinIO is now supported as a storage backend

## Developer Playground

- Rollup designer
- Now supports the new `quarter` granularity
- Support drilldowns in charts made with React ChartJS
- Boolean values are now correctly displayed as `true` or `false`

## Documentation

- A deployment guide for Kubernetes
- A ton of [new recipes](https://cube.dev/docs/recipes) to help you level up
  quickly
