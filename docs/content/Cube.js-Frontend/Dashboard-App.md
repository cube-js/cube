You can generate a Dashboard App in the [Developer
Playground][link-dev-playground]. The Dashboard App wires multiple frontend
components together into single app. It setups all the structure and
configuration to work with Cube.js Backend, while giving you full control to
customize it however you want.

The main purpose of the Dashboard App is to easily get the project up and
running, while keeping it fully customizable. Since it is just a frontend app it
is easy to embed into an existing architecture or deploy to any static website
hosting.

_Currently Dashboard App is generated based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) JS
library and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) UI framework. If you'd like to see
more options with different JS and CSS frameworks please
[open a Github issue](https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/issues/new) or
[ping us in Slack.](https://slack.cube.dev)_

## Overview

Dashboard App is generated in the `dashboard-app` folder within your project
folder. To start the app you either navigate to the "Dashboard App" tab in the
playground and click "Start dashboard app" or run `$ npm run start` in
`your-project-folder/dashboard-app` folder. Dashboard App runs on `3000` port.
You can access it directly by going to
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or inside the Playground under
the "Dashboard App" tab.

Dashboard App uses Cube.js backend to power the query builder and the dashboard.
It also uses Apollo GraphQL with local storage to save meta data such as
dashboard items titles and locations on the dashboard. You can easily switch
from local storage to your own or hosted GraphQL backend.
