Development mode allows to test and debug the data model in
an isolated environment before releasing any changes to production. When the development mode is enabled, a new set of API endpoints is deployed specifically
for the branch.

<SuccessBox>

Development mode is available in Cube Cloud on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

## Finding endpoints

After entering Development Mode, go to the Overview page to see all available
endpoints for the branch:

## Limitations

The Development API has some limitations compared to Production, and it is
important to be aware of these as they may affect your development process.

### <--{"id" : "Limitations"}--> Autoscaling

The Development API **does not** support autoscaling. If you need to test
autoscaling, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a different Git
branch of the same repository.

### <--{"id" : "Limitations"}--> Scheduled refresh

Scheduled refresh is also disabled in the Development API. If you need to test
scheduled refreshes, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a
different Git branch of the same repository.

### <--{"id" : "Limitations"}--> Cube version guarantees

The version of Cube used in the Development API **is not** guaranteed to be the
same each time. If this affects your development process, we recommend reaching
out to our support team.
