The Query History screen in Cube Cloud is a one-stop shop for all performance
and diagnostic information about queries issued for a deployment. It is kept
up-to-date in real time and provides a quick way to check whether queries are
being accelerated with [pre-aggregations][ref-caching-gs-preaggs], how long they
took to execute, and if they failed.

<SuccessBox>

Query History is available in Cube Cloud on
[all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

## Setting the time range

By default, Cube Cloud shows you a live feed of queries made to the API and
connected [data sources][ref-conf-db]. You can see query history for the last 72
hours by using the date picker in the top right corner of the page and selecting
a time period:

/>

To go back to live mode, click <Btn>▶</Btn>:

/>

## Exploring queries

You can switch between [queries made to the API](#inspecting-api-queries) and
[queries made to connected data sources](#inspecting-database-queries) by
switching between the <Btn>API</Btn> and <Btn>Database</Btn> tabs.

/>

### <--{"id" : "API and Database"}--> All Queries and Top Queries

Clicking <Btn>All Queries</Btn> will show all queries in order of recency,
while&nbsp;<Btn>Top Queries</Btn> will show the most-frequently executed
queries:

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(30% 65% 64% 7% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/951a2a64-bc9b-4277-b2fe-4cc88dbf4f49/"
/>

### <--{"id" : "API and Database"}--> Filtering

You can also use filters to find problematic queries; you can filter by query
duration, cache status, whether the query was accelerated, and by failing
queries:

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(36% 22% 58% 7% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/951a2a64-bc9b-4277-b2fe-4cc88dbf4f49/"
/>

## Inspecting API Queries

To see an expanded view of a query, click on <Btn>❯</Btn> next to any query:

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(-1% 87% -1% 9% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/7ec40dc3-813d-4e3e-881b-dc01a6fdfb50/"
/>

This will show us how long the query took, whether the query was accelerated,
and even view the raw query by clicking <Btn>❮/❯</Btn>:

<Screenshot

  src="https://ucarecdn.com/e3c00115-49f9-48a6-8f2b-949c53523c9f/"
/>

To drill down on a specific query, click it to see more information.

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting API Queries"}--> Query

The <Btn>Query</Btn> tab shows the raw JSON query sent to the Cube Cloud
deployment.

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/3c0490be-757d-46cd-ba2d-d7c93a7acf4e/" />

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting API Queries"}--> Errors

If the query failed, the <Btn>Errors</Btn> tab will show you the error message
and stacktrace:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/858633a0-4ee3-4dec-adb6-1d91ca30919f/" />

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting API Queries"}--> SQL

The <Btn>SQL</Btn> tab shows the generated SQL query sent by Cube to either your
data source **or** Cube Store if the query was accelerated with a
pre-aggregation:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/537f7269-654d-479c-a0cc-abc2941f9b5a/" />

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting API Queries"}--> Pre-Aggregations

The <Btn>Pre-Aggregations</Btn> tab shows the
[pre-aggregation][ref-caching-gs-preaggs] used to accelerate this query, if one
was used:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/e0a8d722-d43a-4d6f-8d3c-dbdd3173638e/" />

If no pre-aggregations were used for this query, you should see the following
screen:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/b5cadb89-fbda-404a-806c-da99dc046845/" />

Clicking <Btn>Accelerate</Btn> takes you to the Rollup Designer, where you can
add a pre-aggregation to accelerate similar queries in the future.

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting API Queries"}--> Queue Graph

The <Btn>Queue Graph</Btn> tab details any activity in the query queue while
processing the query. This may include other queries that were being processed
or were waiting in the queue by Cube Cloud at the same time as this query:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/dbac27fa-5722-415f-9374-11682b4159d7/" />

A large number of queries in the queue may indicate that your deployment is
under-provisioned, and you may want to consider scaling up your deployment.

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting API Queries"}--> Flame Graph

The <Btn>Flame Graph</Btn> tab shows a [flame graph][datadog-kb-flamegraph] of a
query's execution time across resources in the Cube Cloud deployment. This is
extremely useful for diagnosing where time is being spent in a query, and can
help identify bottlenecks in your Cube deployment or data source.

## Inspecting Database Queries

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting Database Queries"}--> Query

For Database requests, the <Btn>Query</Btn> tab shows the SQL query compiled by
Cube that is executed on the data source:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/5a5779f6-b484-49bc-9269-6e145b89f5eb/" />

This can be useful for debugging queries that are failing or taking a long time,
as you can copy the query and run it directly against your data source.

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting Database Queries"}--> Errors

If the query failed, the <Btn>Errors</Btn> tab will show you the error message
and stacktrace:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/efd45e3a-8b44-4ee9-9f9e-284f0fd8eb96/" />

Errors here generally indicate a problem with querying the data source. The
generated SQL query can be copied from
the&nbsp;<Btn>[Query](#inspecting-database-queries-query)</Btn> tab and run
directly against your data source to debug the issue.

### <--{"id" : "Inspecting Database Queries"}--> Events

The <Btn>Events</Btn> tab shows all data source-related events that occurred
while the query is in the query execution queue:
