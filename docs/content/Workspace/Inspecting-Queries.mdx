You can inspect Cube queries in a web-based interface and improve their performance with pre-aggregations in Cube Cloud.

Query inspection is available in Cube Cloud on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

## Find slow queries

You can use filters to find slow and not pre-aggregated queries.

## Pre-aggregations

When inspecting queries on the <Btn>Queries</Btn> page, you can now also see
whether the query used a pre-aggregation:

![Query showing pre-aggregation lightning mark|674x500](https://ucarecdn.com/ebdfee8c-37f5-4bc3-8ed4-80f58864012c/)

If you click a query from the list, we now provide more relevant information,
like if the query built a pre-aggregation or not:

![Query request details|690x428](https://ucarecdn.com/93847927-1388-4e14-9782-ec0b6992b993/)

Cube Cloud also provides useful tips for pre-aggregation strategies and
recommends the best pre-aggregation for a specific query. Click on any query on
the <Btn>Queries</Btn> page and navigate to the <Btn>Pre-Aggregations</Btn> tab
inside the query details page.
