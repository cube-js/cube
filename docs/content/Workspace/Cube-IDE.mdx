With the Cube IDE, you can write and test and your Cube data schemas from your
browser.

<SuccessBox>

Cube IDE is available in Cube Cloud on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing). 

</SuccessBox>

Cube Cloud can create branch-based development API instances to quickly
test changes in the data schema in your frontend applications before pushing
them into production.

## Development Mode

In development mode, you can safely make changes to your project without
affecting production deployment. Development mode uses a separate Git branch and
allows testing your changes in Playground or via a separate API endpoint
specific to this branch. This development API hot-reloads your schema changes,
allowing you to quickly test API changes from your applications.

To enter development mode, navigate to the **Schema** page and click **Enter
Development Mode**.

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

When development mode is active, a grey bar will be visible at the top of the
screen. It provides several useful controls and indicators:

- The name of the current development Git branch
- The status of the development API. After any changes to the project, the API
  will hot-reload, and the API status will indicate when it's ready.
- 'Copy API URL' will copy the API URL to the clipboard for the current
  development branch.

    style="border: none"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

You can exit development mode by clicking <Btn>Exit</Btn> in the grey banner. If
you've been editing a schema and navigate away, Cube Cloud will warn you if
there are any unsaved changes:

## Git integration

To add more Git branches to your Cube Cloud deployment and/or switch between
them, click the branch name in the status bar:

![Branch switcher|685x500](https://ucarecdn.com/a3ea164f-b93c-4c83-b7a3-697dd025b74a/)

Speaking of Git branches, you can now easily add and remove branches with the
same switcher; click <Btn>Add Branch</Btn> and enter a name for the new branch
in the popup:

![Create a new branch|690x431](https://ucarecdn.com/15ea528f-4a54-40a1-83c7-2f67738a3e8b/)

These branches are shared, meaning everyone who has access to the deployment can
see and edit them. This makes them extremely useful for out-of-band experiments
where you can quickly test things in Cube Cloud without having to go through a
CI/CD process.

Unused branches can also be deleted. Ensure you are already on the branch you
want to delete, then open the switcher and click <Btn>Remove Branch</Btn>:

![Delete a branch|685x500](https://ucarecdn.com/f1d37fe6-a6ae-4d78-a801-133639daf1ec/)

## Generating models

Cube Cloud supports generating models from a data source after the initial
deployment creation. The <Btn>Generate Schema</Btn> on the <Btn>Schema</Btn>
page will let you re-generate models from your source database, or alternatively
add rollups to existing schemas:
