## Is there a row limit on the results of a query?

The row limit for all query results is set to 10,000 rows by default. You may
specify a row limit up to 50,000 in query parameters for an individual query. If
more rows are needed, we recommend using pagination in your application to
request more rows.

## Can I try Cube Cloud for free?

Currently, Cube Cloud offers Free, Standard and Enterprise plans, with Free
being the default for new Cloud accounts. Each tier comes with different
benefits and data pass-through limits, and you are welcome to remain on the free
tier indefinitely if it satisfies your data needs. More details on what each
plan includes can be found at [cube.dev/pricing](https://cube.dev/pricing).

## What is the difference between CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY and CUBEJS_DB_MAX_POOL?

`CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY` specifies the maximum number of queries that can be
executed concurrently on your source database. This variable should reflect the
limitations of your database, and will help limit the number of queries that are
sent from cube.

`CUBEJS_DB_MAX_POOL` allows you to set a maximum number of connection pools to
your database. This only applies to databases that use connection pooling
(Postgresql, Redshift, Clickhouse) and is not applicable to databases without it
(BigQuery, Snowflake). The concurrency limit specified in `CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY`
will supersede the number of connections if it is lower.

For example, if your database has a hard concurrency limit of 10 that cannot be
changed, but you wish to raise the concurrency limit to 50 you would first set
`CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY=50` and `CUBEJS_DB_MAX_POOL=5` or higher. Note that some
data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake) do not use connection pooling so this
parameter is not applicable.
