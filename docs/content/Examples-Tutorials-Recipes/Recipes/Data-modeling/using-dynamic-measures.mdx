<InfoBox>

This functionality only works with data models written in JavaScript, not YAML.

</InfoBox>

## Use case

We want to understand the distribution of orders by their statuses. Let's
imagine that new order statuses can be added in the future, or we get a list of
statuses from an external API. To calculate the orders percentage distribution,
we need to create several [measures](/schema/fundamentals/concepts#measures)
that refer to each other. But we don't want to manually change the data model for
each new status. To solve this, we will create a
[schema dynamically](/schema/advanced/dynamic-schema-creation).

## Data modeling

To calculate the number of orders as a percentage, we need to know the total
number of orders and the number of orders with the desired status. We'll create
two measures for this. To calculate a percentage, we'll create a measure that
refers to another measure.

```javascript
const statuses = ['processing', 'shipped', 'completed'];

const createTotalByStatusMeasure = (status) => ({
  [`total_${status}_orders`]: {
    type: `count`,
    title: `Total ${status} orders`,
    filters: [
      {
        sql: (CUBE) => `${CUBE}."status" = '${status}'`,
      },
    ],
  },
});

const createPercentageMeasure = (status) => ({
  [`percentage_of_${status}`]: {
    type: `number`,
    format: `percent`,
    title: `Percentage of ${status} orders`,
    sql: (CUBE) =>
      `ROUND(${CUBE[`total_${status}_orders`]}::numeric / ${
        CUBE.total_orders
      }::numeric * 100.0, 2)`,
  },
});

cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  measures: Object.assign(
    {
      total_orders: {
        type: `count`,
        title: `Total orders`,
      },
    },
    statuses.reduce(
      (all, status) => ({
        ...all,
        ...createTotalByStatusMeasure(status),
        ...createPercentageMeasure(status),
      }),
      {}
    )
  ),
});
```

## Result

Using the measures defined above, we can explore the orders percentage
distribution and easily create new measures just by adding a new status.

```javascript
[
  {
    'orders.percentage_of_processing': '33.54',
    'orders.percentage_of_shipped': '33.00',
    'orders.percentage_of_completed': '33.46',
  },
];
```

or run it with the `docker-compose up` command. You'll see the result, including
queried data, in the console.
