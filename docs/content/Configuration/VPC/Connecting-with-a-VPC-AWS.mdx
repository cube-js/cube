## Prerequisites

To allow Cube Cloud to connect to a VPC on AWS, the following information is
required:

- **AWS Account ID:** The AWS account ID of the VPC owner. This can be found in
  the top-right corner of [the AWS Console][aws-console].
- **AWS Region:** [The AWS region][aws-docs-regions] that the VPC resides in.
  Ensure that the region is available in [Supported Regions](#supported-regions)
  to see if Cube Cloud VPC connectivity is available in your region.
- **AWS VPC ID:** The ID of the VPC that Cube Cloud will connect to, for example
  `vpc-0099aazz`
- **AWS VPC CIDR:** The CIDR block of the VPC that Cube Cloud will connect to,
  for example `10.0.0.0/16`

## Setup

### VPC Peering Request

After receiving the information above, Cube Cloud will send a [VPC peering
request][aws-docs-vpc-peering] that must be accepted. This can be done either
through the [AWS Web Console][aws-console] or through an infrastructure-as-code
tool.

To accept the VPC peering request through the AWS Web Console, follow [the
instructions here][aws-docs-vpc-peering-accept] with the following amendments:

- On Step 4, verify the peering request is from Cube Cloud by checking that the
  AWS account ID, region and VPC IDs match those provided by Support.
- On Step 5, ensure **Modify my route tables now** is selected so that the
  necessary routes are created.
- After Step 5, the security group for any databases within the VPC
  [may require updating](#updating-security-groups) to allow traffic from Cube
  Cloud.

### Updating security groups

Often the initial VPC setup will not allow traffic from Cube Cloud; this is
usually because [the security group][aws-docs-vpc-security-group] for the
database will need to allow access from the Cube Cloud CIDR block.

This can be achieved by adding a new security group rule:

- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Port Range:** The database port, usually `3306` for MySQL or `5432` for
  Postgres.
- **Source/Destination:** The Cube Cloud CIDR block for the AWS region.

## Supported Regions

- `ca-central-1`
- `eu-central-1`
- `eu-west-1`
- `us-east-1`
- `us-east-2`
- `us-west-2`
