To enable VPC support for your account, please [contact Sales][cube-contact].

For improved stability and security, Cube Cloud also supports connecting to one
or more VPCs in your AWS or Google Cloud accounts. A Cube Cloud VPC connection
improves stability through dedicated infrastructure for a deployment, and
improves security by preventing your database traffic from being routed through
the public Internet.
