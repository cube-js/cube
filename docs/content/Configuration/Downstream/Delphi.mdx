[Delphi][delphi-website] is a conversational interface for the semantic layer,
powered by the large language model (LLM) technology by OpenAI.

It provides a Slack bot that takes questions in natural language, translates
them into queries to Cube, and delivers the results back to Slack. You can learn
more about Delphi from the [blog post][delphi-blog-post] or see it in action in
this video:

To start using Delphi, you need to install its bot (application) to your Slack
workspace, configure it, add to necessary channels, and start asking questions.

## Installing Delphi to Slack

Go to the [Slack application][delphi-slack-install] page; this will start the
installation.

<InfoBox>

You may need to be a Slack workspace administrator to install a new application.

</InfoBox>

## Configuring the connection to Cube

In Slack, navigate to the <Btn>Delphi</Btn> app on the left sidebar.

In the <Btn>Home</Btn> tab, choose <Btn>Cube</Btn> as the connection type:

Then, enter your credentials:

- Delphi Client ID and API Key
- Cube [REST API][ref-rest-api] URL and a
  [JSON Web Token](http://localhost:8000/security#generating-json-web-tokens-jwt)

<InfoBox>

If you donâ€™t have Delphi Client ID and API Key yet, get them by
[email][delphi-email] from the Delphi team.

</InfoBox>

## Asking questions

Send Delphi a direct message or add it to relevant channels.

Start with `@Delphi` and ask anything about your Cube [data
model][ref-data-model].
