### Cube Cloud

Click **How to connect your BI tool** link on the Overview page, navigate to the SQL API tab
and enable it. Once enabled, you should see the screen like the one below with
your connection credentials:

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

### Self-hosted Cube

You need to set the following environment variables to enable the Cube SQL API.
These credentials will be required to connect to Cube from Apache Superset
later.

```dotenv
CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432
CUBE_SQL_USERNAME=myusername
CUBE_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

## Connecting from Power BI

Power BI connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

## Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions are columns.
