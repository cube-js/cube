title: Connecting to Bubble
permalink: /config/downstream/bubble

[Bubble](https://bubble.io/) is one of the oldest and most comprehensive
low-code app-building platforms on the market. You can connect a Cube deployment
to Bubble using Cube’s
[REST API](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/rest/reference/api).

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Bubble to Cube.

## Use REST API in Cube

> Don't have a Cube project yet?
> [Learn how to get started here](https://cube.dev/docs/cloud/getting-started).

### <--{"id" : "Use REST API in Cube"}--> Cube Cloud

Click the "How to connect" link on the Overview page, navigate to the REST API
tab. You will see your connection credentials, the REST API URL and the
authorization token:

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

### <--{"id" : "Use REST API in Cube"}--> Self-hosted Cube

For a Cube instance publicly available at a specific `HOST`, the REST API URL
would be `HOST/cubejs-api/v1`. Please refer to the
[REST API page](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/rest/reference/api) for details.

You will also need to generate a JSON Web Token that would be used to
authenticate requests to Cube.

Please check the
[Security page](https://cube.dev/docs/security#generating-json-web-tokens-jwt)
to learn how to generate a token. We suggest generating a long-lived JWT that
won't expire soon.

## Add an API connector plugin to your Bubble app

Navigate to the plugins. Select and install the API connector plugin.

## Create a new API in Bubble

Click "Add another API".

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Next, set the "Authentication" as "Private key in header", and copy and paste
Cube's Authorization token. Additionally, make sure to add a shared header for
all calls by setting `content-type` to `application/json`.

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

## Create a POST request in Bubble

Click "Add another call".

Copy and paste the Cube REST API, including the `/load` path, in the API field.
Make sure to select "Use as: Action", and use the `JSON` "data type" and "body
type".

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Get your Cube query in the JSON
[query format](https://cube.dev/docs/backend/rest/reference/query-format) ready.
You can copy it from Cube’s Playground or compose manually:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/d2104545-cba1-4b63-84ab-d9d0a7051d7f/"
    style="border: none"
    width="50%"
  />
</div>

Paste the JSON query in the **Body**. Make sure to add a `query` parameter for
your JSON query.

<div style="text-align: center">

    src="https://ucarecdn.com/4e86bc38-56bb-44bc-b99d-6b55bb963761/"
    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Next, hit "Initialize / Reinitialize call".

## Create a workflow in Bubble

First, add a "Page is loaded" event. Add an action that uses the API connector
plugin. Next, add another action to set the state of an element. Select the
index element, and create a new custom state. In this example I named the custom
state `OrdersByMonth` and selected the `data` field of the API response. Make
sure to toggle the "This state is a list" checkbox as well. While setting the
state's value you will need to select "Result of step 1" and the `data` field.

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

## Display the data in Bubble

Bubble has an amazing feature where you can drag and drop UI components into the
design dashboard.

Once you added a chart, you configure the data points. More specifically, the
series categories and series data. For the series categories and series data you
need to select the `index` and `OrdersByMonth` state followed by the data point
you want to use in order to populate the chart.

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Once you open the "Preview" you'll see your nicely rendered charts.
