Cube is designed to work with different configuration sources. There are two
ways you can set configuration options; via [a configuration file][link-config],
commonly known as the `cube.js` file, and [environment
variables][link-env-vars].

<InfoBox>

When using Docker, ensure that the `cube.js` configuration file and your
`schema/` folder are mounted to `/cube/conf` within the Docker container.

</InfoBox>

## Configuration Precedence

In Cube, values specified in `cube.js` take precedence over environment
variables.

## Development Mode

Cube can be run in an insecure, development mode by setting the
`CUBEJS_DEV_MODE` environment variable to `true`. Putting Cube in development
mode does the following:

- Disables authentication checks
- Enables Cube Store in single instance mode
- Enables background refresh for in-memory cache and [scheduled
  pre-aggregations][link-scheduled-refresh]
- Allows another log level to be set (`trace`)
- Enables [Developer Playground][link-dev-playground] on `http://localhost:4000`
- Uses `memory` instead of `redis` as the default cache/queue engine
- Logs incorrect/invalid configuration for `externalRefresh` /`waitForRenew`
  instead of throwing errors

## Configuring CORS

The Cube REST API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for all API
requests. By default, the middleware allows requests from any origin (`*`). To
change the allowed domain, you can do the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  http: {
    cors: {
      origin: 'https://myapp.com',
    },
  },
};
```

Please consult the Configuration Reference [for more
options][link-config-cors-opts].

## Concurrency and pooling

<InfoBox>

All Cube database drivers come with presets for concurrency and pooling that
work out-of-the-box. The following information is included as a reference.

</InfoBox>

For increased performance, Cube uses multiple concurrent connections to
configured data sources. The `CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY` environment variable controls
concurrency settings for query queues and the refresh scheduler as well as the
maximum concurrent connections. For databases that support connection pooling,
the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database can also be set by
using the `CUBEJS_DB_MAX_POOL` environment variable; if changing this from the
default, you must ensure that the new value is greater than the number of
concurrent connections used by Cube's query queues and refresh scheduler.

## Migrating from Express to Docker

Since [`v0.23`][link-v-023-release], Cube CLI uses the `docker` template instead
of `express` as a default for project creation, and it is the recommended route
for production. To migrate you should move all Cube dependencies in
`package.json` to `devDependencies` and leave dependencies that you use to
configure Cube in `dependencies`.

For example, your existing `package.json` might look something like:

```json
{
  "name": "cubejs-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@cubejs-backend/postgres-driver": "^0.20.0",
    "@cubejs-backend/server": "^0.20.0"
  }
}
```

It should become:

```json
{
  "name": "cubejs-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "./node_modules/.bin/cubejs-server server"
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {
    "@cubejs-backend/postgres-driver": "^0.23.6",
    "@cubejs-backend/server": "^0.23.7"
  }
}
```

You should also rename your `index.js` file to `cube.js` and replace the
`CubejsServer.create()` call with export of configuration using
`module.exports`.

For an `index.js` like the following:

```javascript
const CubejsServer = require('@cubejs-backend/server');

const server = new CubejsServer({
  logger: (msg, params) => {
    console.log(`${msg}: ${JSON.stringify(params)}`);
  },
});

server
  .listen()
  .then(({ version, port }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Cube API server (${version}) is listening on ${port}`);
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error('Fatal error during server start: ');
    console.error(e.stack || e);
  });
```

It should be renamed to `cube.js` and its' contents should look like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  logger: (msg, params) => {
    console.log(`${msg}: ${JSON.stringify(params)}`);
  },
};
```

Finally, add a `docker-compose.yml` file alongside the `cube.js` configuration
file:

```yaml
version: '2.2'

services:
  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/cube/conf
```
