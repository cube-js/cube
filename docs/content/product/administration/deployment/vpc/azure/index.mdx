# Connecting with a VNet on Azure

[Dedicated infrastructure][dedicated-infrastructure] in Cube Cloud comes with
an option of setting up a direct network connection between
an Azure VNet on the Cube Cloud side and your own VNet(s). Such a connection allows you to
access internal datasources without the need to expose any ports publicly.

On Azure, Cube Cloud supports two main ways of establishing a private network connection:

- [Azure Private Link][azure-private-link]
- [VNet Peering][azure-vnet-peering]

[dedicated-infrastructure]: /product/administration/deployment/infrastructure#dedicated-infrastructure
[azure-private-link]: /product/administration/deployment/vpc/azure/private-link
[azure-vnet-peering]: /product/administration/deployment/vpc/azure/vpc-peering
