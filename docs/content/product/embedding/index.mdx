# Embedding

Cube provides multiple approaches for embedding analytics into your applications. Choose the method that best fits your use case and technical requirements.

## Iframe-based embedding

<InfoBox>
  Available on [Premium and Enterprise plans](https://cube.dev/pricing).
</InfoBox>

Embed Cube content using iframes for the fastest integration with minimal code. This approach works with any frontend framework and requires no additional dependencies.

Iframe embedding supports [dashboards](/product/presentation/dashboards), [analytics chat](/product/exploration/analytics-chat), and the full Cube application in [creator mode](/product/embedding/creator-mode).

**Authentication options:**
- **[Private embedding](/product/embedding/private-embedding)** – For internal use cases where users authenticate with their Cube accounts
- **[Signed embedding](/product/embedding/signed-embedding)** – For customer-facing applications using JWT tokens for seamless authentication

## React component-based embedding

<InfoBox>
  Available on [Premium and Enterprise plans](https://cube.dev/pricing).
</InfoBox>

Embed Cube using the [React Embed SDK](/product/embedding/react-embed-sdk) for tighter integration with your React applications. Components provide more control over styling, theming, and user interactions.

## API-based embedding

Build fully custom embedded analytics experiences using Cube APIs directly. This headless approach gives you complete control over data fetching, visualization, and user interface.

### Chat API

Use the [Chat API](/product/apis-integrations/embed-apis/chat-api) to build custom conversational analytics experiences. This API-first approach lets you programmatically integrate AI-powered conversations with your data, giving you full control over the chat interface and user experience.

### Core Data APIs

Use the [Core Data APIs](/product/apis-integrations/core-data-apis) to build fully custom visualization, reporting, and dashboarding experiences.
