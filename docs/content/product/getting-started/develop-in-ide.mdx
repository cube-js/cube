# Develop in IDE

The IDE is a place to develop your data model. Cube supports multiple environments based on Git branches, helping you follow software engineering best practices while developing your data model.

## Branch-based development

Cube uses Git branches to create separate environments for development and production. This allows you to safely make changes to your data model without affecting your production environment. When you need to make a change, you can enter development mode or work on a separate branch to test and refine your changes. This isolation ensures that your production data model remains stable while you experiment and iterate.

## Commit and push to production

When your changes are ready, you can commit and push them to your production branch. The IDE helps manage this entire process without requiring you to know how Git and version control work in detail. You can save changes, commit them, and merge into production—all from within the IDE interface.

## AI-assisted development

The IDE includes an AI agent that helps you create data models from scratch and make changes to existing data models. Simply describe what you want to build or modify, and the AI agent will assist you in implementing the changes.
