# Security context

Your authentication server issues JWTs to your client application, which, when
sent as part of the request, are verified and decoded by Cube to get security
context claims to evaluate access control rules. Inbound JWTs are decoded and
verified using industry-standard [JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)][link-auth0-jwks].

For access control or authorization, Cube allows you to define granular access
control rules for every cube in your data model. Cube uses both the request and
security context claims in the JWT token to generate a SQL query, which includes
row-level constraints from the access control rules.

JWTs sent to Cube should be passed in the `Authorization: <JWT>` header to
authenticate requests.

JWTs can also be used to pass additional information about the user, known as a
**security context**. A security context is a verified set of claims about the
current user that the Cube server can use to ensure that users only have access
to the data that they are authorized to access.

It will be accessible as the [`securityContext`][ref-config-sec-ctx] property
inside:

- The [`query_rewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite] configuration option in your
  Cube configuration  file.
- the [`COMPILE_CONTEXT`][ref-cubes-compile-ctx] global, which is used to
  support [multi-tenant deployments][link-multitenancy].

## Contents

By convention, the contents of the security context should be an object (dictionary)
with nested structure:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "user_name": "John Doe",
  "user_id": 42,
  "location": {
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA"
  }
}
```

### Reserved elements

Some features of Cube Cloud (e.g., [authentication integration][ref-auth-integration]
and [LDAP integration][ref-ldap-integration]) use the `cubeCloud` element in the security context.
This element is reserved and should not be used for other purposes.

## Using query_rewrite

You can use [`query_rewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite] to amend incoming queries
with filters. For example, let's take the following query:

```json
{
  "measures": [
    "orders_view.count"
  ],
  "dimensions": [
    "orders_view.status"
  ]
}
```

We'll also use the following as a JWT payload; `user_id`, `sub` and `iat` will
be injected into the security context:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "user_id": 42
}
```

<WarningBox>

Cube expects the context to be an object. If you don't provide an object as the
JWT payload, you will receive the following error:

```bash
Cannot create proxy with a non-object as target or handler
```

</WarningBox>

To ensure that users making this query only receive their own orders, define
`query_rewrite` in the configuration file:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

@config('query_rewrite')
def query_rewrite(query: dict, ctx: dict) -> dict:
  if 'user_id' in ctx['securityContext']:
    query['filters'].append({
      'member': 'orders_view.users_id',
      'operator': 'equals',
      'values': [ctx['securityContext']['user_id']]
    })
  return query
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    
    if (securityContext.user_id) {
      query.filters.push({
        member: "orders_view.users_id",
        operator: "equals",
        values: [securityContext.user_id]
      })
    }

    return query
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

To test this, we can generate an API token as follows:

<CodeTabs>
```python
# Install the PyJWT with pip install PyJWT
import jwt
import datetime

# Secret key to sign the token
CUBE_API_SECRET = 'secret'

# Create the token
token_payload = {
  'user_id': 42
}

# Generate the JWT token
token = jwt.encode(token_payload, CUBE_API_SECRET, algorithm='HS256')
```

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
const CUBE_API_SECRET = "secret"

const cubeToken = jwt.sign({ user_id: 42 }, CUBE_API_SECRET, {
  expiresIn: "30d"
})
```
</CodeTabs>

Using this token, we authorize our request to the Cube API by passing it in the
Authorization HTTP header.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1Ijp7ImlkIjo0Mn0sImlhdCI6MTU1NjAyNTM1MiwiZXhwIjoxNTU4NjE3MzUyfQ._8QBL6nip6SkIrFzZzGq2nSF8URhl5BSSSGZYp7IJZ4" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'query={"measures":["orders.count"]}' \
  http://localhost:4000/cubejs-api/v1/load
```

And Cube will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".STATUS "orders_view__status",
  count("orders".ID) "orders_view__count"
FROM
  ECOM.ORDERS AS "orders"
  LEFT JOIN ECOM.USERS AS "users" ON "orders".USER_ID = "users".ID
WHERE
  ("users".ID = 42)
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC
LIMIT
  5000
```

## Using COMPILE_CONTEXT

`COMPILE_CONTEXT` can be used to create fully dynamic data models. It enables you to create multiple versions of data model based on the incoming security context.
The first thing you need to do is to define the mapping rule from a security context to the id of the compiled data model.
It is done with `context_to_app_id` configuration option.

```python
from cube import config
 
@config('context_to_app_id')
def context_to_app_id(ctx: dict) -> str:
  return ctx['securityContext']['team']
```

It is common to use some field from the incoming security context as an id for your data model. 
In our example, as illustrated below, we are using `team` property of the security context as a data model id.

<Diagram
  alt="COMPILE_CONTEXT mapping"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/7b6a2257-ca50-45e9-a4a4-a177a931407c/"
/>

Once you have this mapping, you can use `COMPILE_CONTEXT` inside your data model. 
In the example below we are passing it as a variable into `masked` helper function.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql_table: ECOM.USERS
    public: false

    dimensions:
      - name: last_name
        sql: {{ masked('LAST_NAME', COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext) }}
        type: string
```

This `masked` helper function is defined in `model/globals.py` as follows: it checks if the current `team` is inside the list of trusted teams. 
If that's the case, it will render the SQL to get the value of the dimension; if not, it will return just the masked string.


```python
from cube import TemplateContext
 
template = TemplateContext()

@template.function('masked')
def masked(sql, security_context):
  trusted_teams = ['cx', 'exec' ]
  is_trusted_team = security_context.setdefault('team') in trusted_teams
  if is_trusted_team:
    return sql
  else:
    return "'--- masked ---'"
```

### Usage with pre-aggregations

To generate pre-aggregations that rely on `COMPILE_CONTEXT`, [configure
`scheduledRefreshContexts` in your `cube.js` configuration
file][ref-config-sched-refresh].

### Usage for member-level security

You can also use `COMPILE_CONTEXT` to control whether a data model entity should be
public or private [dynamically][ref-dynamic-data-modeling].

In the example below, the `customers` view would only be visible to a subset
of [tenants][ref-multitenancy] that have the `team` property set to `marketing`
in the security context: 

```yml filename="model/views/customers.yml"
views:
  - name: customers
    public: "{{ is_accessible_by_team('marketing', COMPILE_CONTEXT) }}"
```

```python filename="model/globals.py"
from cube import TemplateContext

template = TemplateContext()

@template.function('is_accessible_by_team')
def is_accessible_by_team(team: str, ctx: dict) -> bool:
  return team == ctx['securityContext'].setdefault('team', 'default')
```

If you'd like to keep a data model entity public but prevent access to it
anyway, you can use the [`query_rewrite` configuration option][ref-query-rewrite] for that.

## Testing during development

During development, it is often useful to be able to edit the security context
to test access control rules. The [Developer
Playground][ref-devtools-playground] allows you to set your own JWTs, or you can
build one from a JSON object.

## Enriching the security context

Sometimes it is convenient to enrich the security context with additional attributes
before it is used to evaluate access control rules.

### Extending the security context

You can use the [`extend_context`][ref-extend-context] configuration option to
enrich the security context with additional attributes.

### Authentication integration

When using Cube Cloud, you can enrich the security context with information about
an authenticated user, obtained during their authentication or loaded via an
[LDAP integration][ref-ldap-integration].

<SuccessBox>

Authentication integration is available in Cube Cloud on [all product tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

You can enable the authentication integration by navigating to the <Btn>Settings → Configuration</Btn>
of your Cube Cloud deployment and using the <Btn>Enable Cloud Auth Integration</Btn> toggle.

## Common patterns

### Enforcing mandatory filters

You can use `query_rewrite` to enforce mandatory filters that apply to all queries. This is useful when you need to ensure certain conditions are always met, such as filtering data by date range or restricting access to specific data subsets.

For example, if you want to only show orders created after a specific date across all queries, you can add a mandatory filter:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

@config('query_rewrite')
def query_rewrite(query: dict, ctx: dict) -> dict:
  query['filters'].append({
    'member': 'orders.created_at',
    'operator': 'afterDate',
    'values': ['2019-12-30']
  })
  return query
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  queryRewrite: (query) => {
    query.filters.push({
      member: `orders.created_at`,
      operator: "afterDate",
      values: ["2019-12-30"]
    })

    return query
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

This filter will be automatically applied to all queries, ensuring that only orders created after December 30th, 2019 are returned, regardless of any other filters specified in the query.

### Enforcing role-based access

You can use `query_rewrite` to enforce role-based access control by filtering data based on the user's role from the security context.

For example, to restrict access so that users with the `operator` role can only view processing orders, while users with the `manager` role can only view shipped and completed orders:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

@config('query_rewrite')
def query_rewrite(query: dict, ctx: dict) -> dict:
  if not ctx['securityContext'].get('role'):
    raise ValueError("No role found in Security Context!")

  role = ctx['securityContext']['role']
  
  if role == "manager":
    query['filters'].append({
      'member': 'orders.status',
      'operator': 'equals',
      'values': ['shipped', 'completed']
    })
  elif role == "operator":
    query['filters'].append({
      'member': 'orders.status',
      'operator': 'equals',
      'values': ['processing']
    })

  return query
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    if (!securityContext.role) {
      throw new Error("No role found in Security Context!")
    }

    if (securityContext.role == "manager") {
      query.filters.push({
        member: "orders.status",
        operator: "equals",
        values: ["shipped", "completed"]
      })
    }

    if (securityContext.role == "operator") {
      query.filters.push({
        member: "orders.status",
        operator: "equals",
        values: ["processing"]
      })
    }

    return query
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### Enforcing column-based access

You can use `query_rewrite` to enforce column-based access control by filtering data based on relationships and user attributes from the security context.

For example, to restrict suppliers to only see their own products based on their email:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

@config('query_rewrite')
def query_rewrite(query: dict, ctx: dict) -> dict:
  cube_names = [
    *(query.get('dimensions', [])),
    *(query.get('measures', []))
  ]
  cube_names = [e.split(".")[0] for e in cube_names]

  if "products" in cube_names:
    email = ctx['securityContext'].get('email')
    if not email:
      raise ValueError("No email found in Security Context!")

    query['filters'].append({
      'member': 'suppliers.email',
      'operator': 'equals',
      'values': [email]
    })

  return query
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  queryRewrite: (query, { securityContext }) => {
    const cubeNames = [
      ...(query.dimensions || []),
      ...(query.measures || [])
    ].map((e) => e.split(".")[0])

    if (cubeNames.includes("products")) {
      if (!securityContext.email) {
        throw new Error("No email found in Security Context!")
      }

      query.filters.push({
        member: `suppliers.email`,
        operator: "equals",
        values: [securityContext.email]
      })
    }

    return query
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### Controlling access to cubes and views

You can use `extend_context` and `COMPILE_CONTEXT` to control access to cubes and views based on user properties from the security context.

For example, to make a view accessible only to users with a `department` claim set to `finance`:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

@config('extend_context')
def extend_context(ctx: dict) -> dict:
  return {
    'securityContext': {
      **ctx['securityContext'],
      'isFinance': ctx['securityContext'].get('department') == 'finance'
    }
  }
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extendContext: ({ securityContext }) => {
    return {
      securityContext: {
        ...securityContext,
        isFinance: securityContext.department === "finance"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

Then in your data model, use `COMPILE_CONTEXT` to control visibility:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
views:
  - name: total_revenue_per_customer
    public: {{ COMPILE_CONTEXT['securityContext']['isFinance'] }}
    # ...
```

```javascript
view(`total_revenue_per_customer`, {
  public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.securityContext.isFinance,
  // ...
})
```

</CodeTabs>
