## Prerequisites

### Base path

REST API is used to communicate with Cube.js backend. All requests are prefixed
with **basePath** described in
[Backend Server Core](@cubejs-backend-server-core). By default it's
`/cubejs-api`.

### Authentication

Cube.js uses API Token for requests' authorization and also for passing
additional security context, which could be used in the
[SECURITY_CONTEXT](/schema/reference/cube#context-variables-security-context)
object in the Data Schema.

The API Token is passed via the Authorization Header. The token itself is a
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io), the [Security section](security) describes how
to generate it.

In the development environment the token is not required for authorization, but
you can still use it to pass a security context.

### Example request

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: EXAMPLE-API-TOKEN" https://example.com/cubejs-api/v1/sql
```

### Continue wait

If the request takes too long to be processed, Cube.js Backend responds with
`{ "error": "Continue wait" }` and 200 status code. To get the data requested,
simply retry your request a bit later.

Possible reasons of **Continue wait**:

- The query requested is heavy and it takes some time for the database to
  process it.
- There are many queries requested and Cube.js backend queues them to save
  database from overloading.

### Error Handling

Cube.js REST API has basic errors and HTTP Error codes for all requests.

| Status | Error response                 | Description                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | Error message                  | General error. It may be a database error, timeout, or other issue. Check error message for details. |
| 403    | Authorization header isn't set | You didn't provide an auth token. Provide a valid API Token or disable authorization.                |
| 403    | Invalid token                  | The auth token provided is not valid. It may be expired or have invalid signature.                   |
| 500    | Error message                  | Cube.js internal server error. Check error message for details.                                      |

### Request Span Annotation

For monitoring tools such as Cube Cloud proper request span annotation should be
provided in `x-request-id` header of a request. Each request id should consist
of two parts: `spanId` and `requestSequenceId` which define `x-request-id` as
whole: `${spanId}-span-${requestSequenceId}`. Values of `x-request-id` header
should be unique for each separate request. `spanId` should define user
interaction span such us `Continue wait` retry cycle and it's value shouldn't
change during one single interaction.

## API Reference

### /v1/load

Get the data for a query.

| Parameter | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| query     | URL encoded Cube.js [Query](/query-format) |

Response

- `query` - The query passed via params. It can be an array of queries and in
  such case it will be treated as a [Data Blending](/data-blending) query.
- `data` - Formatted dataset of query results.
- `annotation` - Metadata for query. Contains descriptions for all query items.
  - `title` - Human readable title from data schema.
  - `shortTitle` - Short title for visualization usage (ex. chart overlay)
  - `type` - Data type

Example request:

```bash
# Request with http method GET
curl \
 -H "Authorization: EXAMPLE-API-TOKEN" \
 -G \
 --data-urlencode 'query={"measures":["Users.count"]}' \
 http://localhost:4000/cubejs-api/v1/load

# Request with http method POST
# Use POST to fix problem with query length limits
curl \
 -X POST
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Authorization: EXAMPLE-API-TOKEN" \
 -G \
 --data '{"query": {"measures":["Users.count"]}}' \
 http://localhost:4000/cubejs-api/v1/load
```

Example response:

```javascript
{
  query:{
    measures:[
      "Users.count"
    ],
    filters:[],
    timezone:"UTC",
    dimensions:[],
    timeDimensions:[]
  },
  data:[
    {
      "Users.count":"700"
    }

        type:"number"
      }
    },
    dimensions:{},
    segments:{},
    timeDimensions:{}
  }
}
```

[[warning | Note]]
| Currently all fetched numericals are returned in the same format as driver returns it without any additional processing. Most of drivers return numerical values as strings instead of javascript integer or float to ensure there's no loss of significance. Client code should take care of parsing such numerical values.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### /v1/sql

### /v1/run-scheduled-refresh

Trigger scheduled refresh run to refresh pre-aggregations. Use it in serverless
deployments.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[[warning | Note]]
| Single call to this API may be not enough to refresh everything is pending.
| This call just populates queue with refresh workload and should be
| continuously called until refresh jobs have completed; otherwise refresh
| jobs will be marked as orphaned, and they will be removed from the queue.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

[scheduled refresh here](/caching/pre-aggregations/getting-started#keeping-pre-aggregations-up-to-date).

| Parameter       | Description                                                                  |
