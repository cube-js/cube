## Aggregation Functions

### COUNT

```sql
COUNT(col)
COUNT(*)
```

**In select from cube table**   
`COUNT` function is used to query measures with type `count`.
When * is specified, queries the first measure with type `count` for a given cube.


**Outside of select from cube table**    
Counts the number of rows.
When * is specified, the count returned is the total number of rows.


### MEASURE

## Date/Time Functions

### <--{"id" : "Date/Time Functions"}--> date_trunc


## Conditional Expressions

### <--{"id" : "Conditional Expressions"}--> CASE

The SQL CASE expression is a generic conditional expression, similar to if/else statements in other programming languages. 

```sql
CASE WHEN condition THEN result
     [WHEN ...]
     [ELSE result]
END
```

**In select from cube table**    
`CASE` clasues are partially supported when selecting from cube tables. We recomend [updating your queries to use outer selects](/backend/sql#querying-fundamentals) if you need to use them. 

**Outside of select from cube table**    
Fully supported.

### COALESCE

The COALESCE function returns the first of its arguments that is not null. Null is returned only if all arguments are null. 
It is often used to substitute a default value for null values when data is retrieved for display.

```sql

```

`COALESCE` function is partially supported when selecting from cube tables. We recomend [updating your queries to use outer selects](/backend/sql#querying-fundamentals) if you need to use them. 

**Outside of select from cube table**

```sql
NULLIF(value1, value2)
```
