## Cube Cloud

The first step to get started with the SQL API in Cube Cloud is to create a
deployment. You can follow this
[step-by-step guide on creating a deployment within Cube Cloud](/cloud/getting-started/create).

Once the deployment is ready, click **How to connect** link on the Overview
page. It will open a modal with instructions on different ways to connect to
Cube. Navigate to the SQL API tab and enable the SQL API.

Once it is enabled, you should see a screen like the one below with your
connection credentials.

<div style="text-align: center">

    style="border: none"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

Since the Cube SQL API is Postgres-compatible, please make sure to select
**Postgres** as a database type when connecting from BI tools.

## Self-hosted Cube

To enable the SQL API, we first need to add a new environment variable:

```dotenv
CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432
```

If you're running Cube through Docker Compose, remember to add a port mapping to
the Cube service for `CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT`:

```yaml
services:
  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube
    ports:
      - 5432:5432 # Cube SQL API
```

Or if running Docker from command line:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 -p 5432:5432 \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  -e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \
  -e CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432 \
  cubejs/cube
```

Then, set Cube SQL credentials auth:

```
CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

Now, you can start your Cube instance and connect via the `psql` client with
provided credentials:

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 5432 -U myusername --password
```
