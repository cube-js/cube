Cube can be configured with dynamic username & password verification system by
setting a [`checkSqlAuth()`][ref-config-check-sql-auth] function in the
`cube.js` configuration file. This function should verify username and return
object with password and security context.

If password returned from this function matches provided in connection string
user will be authenticated with provided security context.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  checkSqlAuth: async (req, username) => {
    if (username === 'fooUser') {
      return {
        password: 'mypassword',
        securityContext: {},
      };
    }

    throw new Error('Incorrect user name or password');
  },
};
```

## Security Context (Row-Level Security)

Cube's SQL API can also use the Security Context for [Dynamic Schema
Creation][ref-dynamic-schemas] or [`queryRewrite`][ref-config-queryrewrite]
property in your [`cube.js` configuration file][ref-config-js].

By default, the SQL API uses the current user's Security Context, but this
behaviour can be modified so that certain users are allowed to switch. To do
this, we must first define which user is allowed to change Security Context:

First, you need to define what user is allowed to change security context:

```
CUBEJS_SQL_SUPER_USER=admin
```

If it's not enough for your case, you define your logic for check with
`canSwitchSqlUser` property in your [`cube.js` configuration
file][ref-config-js].

You can change security context for specific query via virtual filter on:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE __user = 'anotheruser';
```

[ref-config-check-sql-auth]: /config#check-sql-auth
[ref-config-queryrewrite]: /config#query-rewrite
[ref-dynamic-schemas]: /schema/dynamic-schema-creation
