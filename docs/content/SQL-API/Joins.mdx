<WarningBox>

The Cube SQL API currently does not support `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`,
`RIGHT JOIN` and `FULL OUTER JOIN`. We plan to support these types of joins in
future releases.

</WarningBox>

The SQL API supports `CROSS JOIN`s between cubes. When a `CROSS JOIN` is being
processed by Cube, it generates the correct joining conditions for the
underlying data source.

For example, the following query joins the `Orders` and `Products` tables under
the hood with `Orders.product_id = Products.id`, exactly the same way as the
REST API query does:

```sql
cube=> SELECT * FROM Orders CROSS JOIN Products LIMIT 5;
 count | avgValue | totalValue | number | value |  status   |         createdAt          |        completedAt         | __user | count |           name            |            description             |         createdAt          | __user
-------+----------+------------+--------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-------+---------------------------+------------------------------------+----------------------------+--------

     1 |       20 |         20 |     14 |    20 | completed | 2021-02-07 00:00:00.000000 | 2021-03-02 00:00:00.000000 |        |     1 | Unbranded Wooden Mouse    | Outdoors Incredible Rubber Car     | 2019-07-16 00:00:00.000000 |

(5 rows)
```

In the resulting query plan, you won't see any joins as you can't see those for
REST API queries either:

```sql
cube=> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Orders CROSS JOIN Products LIMIT 5;
   plan_type   |            plan
---------------+-----------------------------
 logical_plan  | CubeScan: request={        +
               |   "measures": [            +
               |     "Orders.count",        +
               |     "Orders.avgValue",     +
               |     "Orders.totalValue",   +
               |     "Orders.number",       +
               |     "Products.count"       +
               |   ],                       +
               |   "dimensions": [          +
               |     "Orders.value",        +
               |     "Orders.status",       +
               |     "Orders.createdAt",    +
               |     "Orders.completedAt",  +
               |     "Products.name",       +
               |     "Products.description",+
               |     "Products.createdAt"   +
               |   ],                       +
               |   "segments": [],          +
               |   "limit": 5               +
               | }
 physical_plan | CubeScanExecutionPlan      +
               |
(2 rows)
```

This feature allows you to `CROSS JOIN` cubes even with transitive joins only.

Typically, in tools that allow defining custom SQL datasets, you'd use joined
tables as a dataset SQL. For example:

```sql
SELECT o.count as count, p.name as product_name, p.description as product_description
FROM Orders o
CROSS JOIN Products p;
```

Please note we use aliasing to avoid name clashing between cube members in a
resulting data set. In this case, wrapped SQL will be properly processed by
Cube, pushing down all operations to Cube query:

```sql
cube=> SELECT product_name, SUM(count) FROM (
  SELECT o.count as count, p.name as product_name, p.description as product_description
  FROM Orders o CROSS
  JOIN Products p
) joined
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
       product_name       | SUM(joined.count)
--------------------------+-------------------
 Tasty Plastic Mouse      |               121
 Intelligent Cotton Ball  |               119
 Ergonomic Steel Tuna     |               116
 Intelligent Rubber Pants |               116
 Generic Wooden Gloves    |               116
(5 rows)
```

We can see this by introspecting the `EXPLAIN` plan for this query:

```sql
cube=> EXPLAIN SELECT product_name, SUM(count) FROM (
  SELECT o.count as count, p.name as product_name, p.description as product_description
  FROM Orders o
  CROSS JOIN Products p
) joined
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
   plan_type   |         plan
---------------+-----------------------
 logical_plan  | CubeScan: request={  +
               |   "measures": [      +
               |     "Orders.count"   +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "dimensions": [    +
               |     "Products.name"  +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "segments": [],    +
               |   "order": [         +
               |     [                +
               |       "Orders.count",+
               |       "desc"         +
               |     ]                +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "limit": 5         +
               | }
 physical_plan | CubeScanExecutionPlan+
               |
(2 rows)
```

Please note even if `product_description` is in the inner selection, it isn't
evaluated in the final query as it isn't used in any way.

As an alternative to achieve joins it is also possible to define proxy dimension
or measure inside the Cube.

```js
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.orders`,

  joins: {
    Users: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.user_id = ${Users}.id`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    // this is proxy dimension
    user_city: {
      sql: `${Users.city}`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`Users`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.users`,

  measures: {},

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primaryKey: true,
    },

    city: {
      sql: `city`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

Now, it is possible to get orders count by users city with the following query.

```
cube=> SELECT count, user_city FROM Orders;
 count |   user_city
