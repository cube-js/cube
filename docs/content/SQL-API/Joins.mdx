The SQL API supports joins through `__cubeJoinField` virtual column, which is
available in every cube table. Join can also be done through `CROSS JOIN`. Usage
of `__cubeJoinField` in a join instructs Cube to perform join as it's defined in
a data schema. Cube generates the correct joining conditions for the underlying
data source.

For example, the following query joins the `Orders` and `Products` tables under
the hood with `Orders.product_id = Products.id`, exactly the same way as the
REST API query does:

```sql
cube=> SELECT p.name, SUM(o.count) FROM Orders o LEFT JOIN Products p ON o.__cubeJoinField = p.__cubeJoinField GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 5;
           name           | SUM(o.count)
--------------------------+--------------
 Tasty Plastic Mouse      |          121
 Intelligent Cotton Ball  |          119
 Ergonomic Steel Tuna     |          116
 Intelligent Rubber Pants |          116
 Generic Wooden Gloves    |          116
(5 rows)
```

Or through `CROSS JOIN`:

```sql
cube=> SELECT p.name, sum(o.count) FROM Orders o CROSS JOIN Products p GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 5;
           name           | SUM(o.count)
--------------------------+--------------
 Tasty Plastic Mouse      |          121
 Intelligent Cotton Ball  |          119
 Ergonomic Steel Tuna     |          116
 Intelligent Rubber Pants |          116
 Generic Wooden Gloves    |          116
(5 rows)
```

In the resulting query plan, you won't see any joins as you can't see those for
REST API queries either:

```sql
cube=> EXPLAIN SELECT p.name, sum(o.count) FROM Orders o LEFT JOIN Products p ON o.__cubeJoinField = p.__cubeJoinField GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 5;
   plan_type   |         plan
---------------+-----------------------
 logical_plan  | CubeScan: request={  +
               |   "measures": [      +
               |     "Orders.count"   +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "dimensions": [    +
               |     "Products.name"  +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "segments": [],    +
               |   "limit": 5         +
               | }
 physical_plan | CubeScanExecutionPlan+
               |
(2 rows)
```

This feature allows you to join cubes even joined transitively only.

In most of the BI tools you'd use `__cubeJoinField` to define joins between cube
tables. In tools that allow defining custom SQL datasets, you can use joined
tables as a dataset SQL. For example:

```sql
SELECT o.count as count, p.name as product_name, p.description as product_description
FROM Orders o
CROSS JOIN Products p;
```

Please note we use aliasing to avoid name clashing between cube members in a
resulting data set. In this case, wrapped SQL will be properly processed by
Cube, pushing down all operations to Cube query:

```sql
cube=> SELECT product_name, SUM(count) FROM (
  SELECT o.count as count, p.name as product_name, p.description as product_description
  FROM Orders o CROSS
  JOIN Products p
) joined
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
       product_name       | SUM(joined.count)
--------------------------+-------------------
 Tasty Plastic Mouse      |               121
 Intelligent Cotton Ball  |               119
 Ergonomic Steel Tuna     |               116
 Intelligent Rubber Pants |               116
 Generic Wooden Gloves    |               116
(5 rows)
```

We can see this by introspecting the `EXPLAIN` plan for this query:

```sql
cube=> EXPLAIN SELECT product_name, SUM(count) FROM (
  SELECT o.count as count, p.name as product_name, p.description as product_description
  FROM Orders o
  CROSS JOIN Products p
) joined
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
   plan_type   |         plan
---------------+-----------------------
 logical_plan  | CubeScan: request={  +
               |   "measures": [      +
               |     "Orders.count"   +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "dimensions": [    +
               |     "Products.name"  +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "segments": [],    +
               |   "order": [         +
               |     [                +
               |       "Orders.count",+
               |       "desc"         +
               |     ]                +
               |   ],                 +
               |   "limit": 5         +
               | }
 physical_plan | CubeScanExecutionPlan+
               |
(2 rows)
```

Please note even if `product_description` is in the inner selection, it isn't
evaluated in the final query as it isn't used in any way.

## Proxy Dimensions and Views

As an alternative to achieve joins it is also possible to define proxy dimension
or measure inside a cube or a view. This is the preferred way of joining as it
provides you control over the joining path for complex use cases.

```javascript
view(`OrdersUsers`, {
  includes: [Orders],
  dimensions: {
    // this is proxy dimension
    user_city: {
      sql: `${Users.city}`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});
```

Now, it is possible to get orders count by users city with the following query.

```sql
cube=> SELECT count, user_city FROM OrdersUsers;
 count |   user_city
