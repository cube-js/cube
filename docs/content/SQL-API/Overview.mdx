<WarningBox heading={`Migration to Postgres protocol`}>

This is documentation of Cube’s SQL API for the Postgres protocol. The MySQL
protocol used in the first versions of the Cube SQL API is no longer being
developed and will be phased out soon. Please consider migrating to the Postgres
protocol.

</WarningBox>

The Cube SQL API allows querying Cube via Postgres-compatible SQL. It enables
the use of BI applications, Python notebooks, reverse ETL tools, and other
downstream tools on top of Cube.

## Querying Fundamentals

Under the hood, SQL API uses
[Apache Datafusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) as its SQL execution
engine. It's responsible for query planning and execution. As the conversion
process from SQL to Cube Query can be ambiguous, an additional step of query
rewriting is done before the query is executed. During this step, the query plan
is rewritten such that the maximum number of Cube Queries can be detected within
the given query plan. Overall, rewriting is a seamless process. There are some
practical considerations that you should keep in mind while querying, though.

In the SQL API, each cube is represented as a table. Measures, dimensions, and
segments in this table are columns. We call these tables **cube tables**.

Consider the `Orders` cube in your data model, the following query is performing
a `SELECT` from the **cube table** `Orders`.

```sql
SELECt
  city,
  SUM(amount)
FROM Orders
WHERE status = 'shipped'
GROUP BY 1
```

The SQL API transforms `SELECT` query fragments from **cube tables** into
[Cube's internal query format](/backend/rest/reference/query-format). This
process is called **Cube Query Rewrite**.

The SQL query above would be rewritten into the following Cube query:

```json
{
  "measures": ["Orders.amount"],
  "dimensions": ["Orders.city"],
  "filters": [
    {
      "member": "Orders.status",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": ["shipped"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Because of this transformation, not all functions and expressions are supported
in query fragments performing `SELECT` from cube tables. Please refer to the
reference to see whether a specific expression or function is supported. For
example, the following query won't work because the SQL API can't push down the
`case` expression to Cube for processing. It is not possible to translate `case`
expression in measure.

```sql
-- This query won't work because of the Cube query rewrite
SELECT
  city,
  CASE
    WHEN status = 'shipped' THEN 'done'
    ELSE 'in-progress'
  END real_status,
  SUM(number)
FROM Orders
  CROSS JOIN Users
GROUP BY 1;
```

You can leverage nested queries in cases like this. You can wrap your `SELECT`
statement from a cube table into another `SELECT` statement to perform
calculations with expressions like `CASE`. This outer select is **not** part of
the SQL query that being rewritten and thus allows you to use more SQL
functions, operators and expressions. You can rewrite the above query as
follows, making sure to wrap the original `SELECT` statement:

```sql
--- You can also use CTEs to achieve the same result
SELECT
  city,
  CASE
    WHEN status = 'shipped' THEN 'done'
    ELSE 'in-progress'
  END real_status,
  SUM(amount) AS total
FROM (
  SELECT
    Users.city AS city,
    SUM(number) AS amount,
    Orders.status
  FROM Orders
    CROSS JOIN Users
  GROUP BY 1, 3
) AS inner
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;
```

The above query works because the `CASE` expression is supported in `SELECT`
queries **not** querying cube tables.

When querying cube tables, it is important to understand fundamentals of Cube
query rewrite as well as the **pushdown** process. **Pushdown** is a process of
pushing the processing of a particular part of the query down to the inner
`SELECT` from the cube table. The following sections provide an overview of Cube
query rewrite and pushdown. Please refer to the reference to see whether
specific functions, operators or expressions are supported in Cube query
rewrite.

### <--{"id" : "Querying cube tables"}--> Aggregated vs Non-aggregated queries

There are two types of queries supported against **cube tables**: aggregated and
non-aggregated. Aggregated are those with `GROUP BY` statement, and
non-aggregated are those without. Cube queries issued to your database will
always be aggregated, and it doesn't matter if you provide `GROUP BY` in a query
or not.

Whenever you use a non-aggregated query you need to provide only column names in
SQL:

```
SELECT status, count FROM Orders
```

The same aggregated query should always aggregate measure columns using a
corresponding aggregating function or special `MEASURE()` function:

<WarningBox>

In cases where measure columns are not aggregated
`Projection references non-aggregate values` error will be thrown. It means
there are columns that are neither in `GROUP BY` or aggregated. This is a
standard SQL `GROUP BY` operation consistency check enforced by SQL API as well.

</WarningBox>

```
SELECT status, SUM(count) FROM Orders GROUP BY 1
SELECT status, MEASURE(count) FROM Orders GROUP BY 1
```

### <--{"id" : "Querying cube tables"}--> Filtering

Cube supports most simple equality operators like `=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`,
`>=` as well as `IN` and `LIKE` operators. Cube tries to push down all filters
into Cube query. In some cases, SQL filters aren't available in Cube and can be
done in a post-processing phase. Time dimension filters will be converted to
time dimension date ranges whenever it's possible.

### <--{"id" : "Querying cube tables"}--> Ordering

Cube tries to push down all `ORDER BY` statements into Cube Query.

If it can't be done ordering part would be done in a post-processing phase. In
case there are more than 50k rows in the result set, incorrect results can be
received in this case. Please use `EXPLAIN` in order to check if it's the case.

Consider the following query.

```sql
SELECT
  status,
  SUM(total_value) + 2 as transformed_amount
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM Orders
) orders
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY status DESC
LIMIT 100
```

Because of the expression `SUM(total_value) + 2` in the projection of outer
query, Cube can't push down `ORDER`.

You can run `EXPLAIN` against the above query to look at the plan. As you can
see below, the sorting operation is done after Cube query and projection.

```
+ GlobalLimitExec: skip=None, fetch=100
+- SortExec: [transformed_amount@1 DESC]
+-- ProjectionExec: expr=[status@0 as status, SUM(orders.total_value)@1 + CAST(2 AS Float64) as transformed_amount]
+--- CubeScanExecutionPlan
```

Because of the default limit in Cube queries (50k rows), there is a possibility
of a wrong result if there are more than 50k rows. Given that queries to Cube
are usually aggregated, it is rare that they may return more than 50k rows, but
keep that limitation in mind when designing your queries.

### <--{"id" : "Querying cube tables"}--> Limit

Limit push down is supported by Cube however, a limit over 50k can't be
overridden. In future versions, paging and streaming would be used to avoid this
limitation.

## Examples

Consider the following schema.

```javascript
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    created: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

It would be represented as table in SQL API with `count`, `status`, `created`
columns.

To get the count of orders grouped by status we can run the following query.

```
cube=> SELECT count, status FROM Orders;
 count |   status
-------+------------
 15513 | completed
 14652 | processing
 13829 | shipped
(3 rows)
```

Cube will automatically apply the `GROUP BY` clause in case it is missing in the
query. We can also provide the `GROUP BY` statement to control how results are
grouped. In the following example, we group orders by created month and also by
status within every month.

```
cube=> SELECT MEASURE(count), status, DATE_TRUNC('month', createdAt) date FROM Orders GROUP BY date, status ORDER BY date asc;
 measure(Orders.count) |   status   |            date
-----------------------+------------+----------------------------
                    31 | shipped    | 2016-01-01 00:00:00.000000
                    28 | completed  | 2016-01-01 00:00:00.000000
                    28 | processing | 2016-01-01 00:00:00.000000
                    28 | shipped    | 2016-02-01 00:00:00.000000
                    18 | processing | 2016-02-01 00:00:00.000000
                    28 | completed  | 2016-02-01 00:00:00.000000
                    54 | processing | 2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000
                    57 | completed  | 2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000
                    56 | shipped    | 2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000
                    54 | shipped    | 2016-04-01 00:00:00.000000
                    60 | completed  | 2016-04-01 00:00:00.000000
                    43 | processing | 2016-04-01 00:00:00.000000
                    55 | shipped    | 2016-05-01 00:00:00.000000
```

### <--{"id" : "Examples"}--> Querying Dimensions

Querying dimensions is straightforward, simply add any required fields to the
`SELECT` clause.

```sql
cube=> SELECT status FROM Orders;
   status
------------
 completed
 processing
 shipped
(3 rows)
```

### <--{"id" : "Examples"}--> Querying Measures

Measures can similarly be queried through Cube SQL.

Because measures are already aggregated in Cube there is no need to apply
aggregate functions to them in SQL API if you don't have a `GROUP BY` statement
in query.

```
cube=> SELECT count FROM Orders;
 count
-------
 43994
(1 row)
```

Some BI systems or SQL constraints may require you to apply aggregate functions.
To support this, Cube allows aggregate functions on measures as long as they
match the type of the measure.

`count` measure in our example is of type `count`, It means we can apply
`COUNT()` aggregate function to it. The below query is similar to the above one.

```
cube=> SELECT COUNT(count) FROM Orders;
 COUNT(Orders.count)
---------------------
               43994
(1 row)
```

There's also universal aggregate function `MEASURE()` that matches any measure
type.

```
cube=> SELECT MEASURE(count) FROM Orders;
 measure(Orders.count)
-----------------------
                 43994
(1 row)
```

Let's look at more measures types:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  ...,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
    distinctCount: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `countDistinct`,
    },
    approxDistinctCount: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `countDistinctApprox`,
    },
    minValue: {
      sql: `min_value`,
      type: `min`
    },
    maxValue: {
      sql: `max_value`,
      type: `max`
    },
  },
})
```

As we can see, we have a mix of measure types in the above schema. To query
them, we could use the following SQL statements:

```sql
--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT count FROM Orders
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders

--- Count distinct, and count distinct approx
--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT distinctCount FROM Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT distinctCount) FROM Orders

--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT approxDistinctCount FROM Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT approxDistinctCount) FROM Orders

--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT minValue FROM Orders
SELECT MIN(minValue) FROM Orders

--- Both the following statements are equivalent
SELECT maxValue FROM Orders
SELECT MAX(maxValue) FROM Orders
```

### <--{"id" : "Examples"}--> Querying Segments

Any segments defined in a schema can also be used in Cube SQL queries. Looking
at the schema below, we have one segment `isCompleted`:

```javascript
cube('Orders', {
  ...,

  segments: {
    isCompleted: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`,
    },
  },
});
```

Segments must be used as `boolean` types in Cube SQL queries:

```sql
WHERE isCompleted = true
```
