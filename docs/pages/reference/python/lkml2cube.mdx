# `lkml2cube` package

`lkml2cube` package facilitates the migration from [Looker][link-looker]
to Cube. It provides a convenient command-line tool for converting
[LookML][link-lookml] models into the Cube data model.

* Install [`lkml2cube`][link-lkml2cube-pypi] package from PyPI
* Check the source code in [`lkml2cube`][link-lkml2cube-repo] on GitHub
* Submit issues to [`cube`][link-cube-repo-issues] on GitHub

## Installation

Run the following command:

```bash
pip install lkml2cube
```

## Usage

There are two commands: `cubes` and `views`. Both commands read all the
files in the provided input parameter, including those referenced by the
LookML keyword `include`.

### `cubes`

The `cubes` command would inspect LookML [views][link-lookml-views] and
generate [cubes][ref-cubes].

Since join relationships are defined at the `explore` level in LookML
syntax, generated cubes would not have [join][ref-joins] definitions.

#### Debugging

Run the following command to display a representation of a LookML object
as a Python dictionary:

```bash
lkml2cube cubes --parseonly path/to/file.view.lkml
```

#### Converting

Run the following command to convert LookML [views][link-lookml-views]
into [cubes][ref-cubes]:

```bash
lkml2cube cubes path/to/file.view.lkml --outputdir ./
```

### `views`

The `views` command would inspect LookML [explores][link-lookml-explores]
and generate [cubes][ref-cubes] and [views][ref-views].

Since join relationships are defined at the `explore` level in LookML
syntax, generated cubes and views would have [join][ref-joins] definitions.

#### Converting

Run the following command to convert LookML [explores][link-lookml-explores]
into [cubes][ref-cubes] and [views][ref-views]:

```bash
lkml2cube views path/to/file.explore.lkml --outputdir ./
```
