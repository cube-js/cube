# Error message reference

Working with Cube, you might encounter various error messages in logs and API responses.
This page lists some of them with some practical advice on mitigation.

## `Aggregate function calls cannot be nested`

```
Aggregate function calls cannot be nested
```

Error message above comes from an upsream data source and indicates that
there's a nested aggregation in a query, e.g., that there's a measure
with an aggregation that references another measure with an aggregation.

**Please check your data model for such cases.**

Nested aggregations are indeed useful in some cases. Please [see a
recipe](/guides/recipes/data-modeling/nested-aggregates) that explains
how to model them.


## `Can't find join path`

```
Can't find join path to join 'cube_a', 'cube_b'
```

Error message above indicates that a query failed because it includes members from cubes
that can't be joined in order to generate a valid query to the upstream data source.

**Please check that you've defined necessary [joins](/reference/data-model/joins)
and that they have [correct directions](/product/data-modeling/concepts/working-with-joins#transitive-join-pitfalls).**

Also, please consider using [views](/reference/data-model/view) since they
incapsulate join paths and completely remove the possibility of the error in question.
You might also consider setting [`public: false`](/reference/data-model/cube#public)
on your cubes to hide them from end users.

If you’re building a custom data application, you might use the [`meta` endpoint](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api/reference#v1meta)
of the REST API. It groups cubes into `connectedComponents` to help select those ones
that can be joined together.

## `Can't parse timestamp`

```
Can't parse timestamp: 2023-11-07T14:33:23.16.000
```

Error message above indicates that the data source was unable to recognize
the value of a [time dimension](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#time-1)
as a timestamp.

**Please check that the [SQL expression](/product/data-modeling/syntax#sql-expressions)
of this time dimension evaluates to a `TIMESTAMP` type.**

Also, check this recipe to see how you can [work around string values in
time dimensions](/guides/recipes/data-modeling/string-time-dimensions).

## `Primary key is required when join is defined`

```
cube_a cube: primary key for 'cube_a' is required when join is defined
in order to make aggregates work properly
```

Error message above indicates that you have a [cube](/reference/data-model/cube)
with [joins](/reference/data-model/joins) and
[pre-aggregations](/reference/data-model/pre-aggregations). However, that cube
doesn't have a primary key.

When generating SQL queries, Cube uses primary keys to avoid fanouts.
A fanout happens when two tables are joined and a single value gets duplicated in the end result,
meaning that some values can be double counted. 

**Please define a [primary key](/reference/data-model/dimensions#primary_key) dimension in this cube to make joins and pre-aggregations work correctly.**

If your data doesn't have a natural primary key, e.g., `id`, you can define a composite
primary key by concatenating most or all of the columns in the table, e.g.:


```yml
cubes:
  - name: cube_a
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: composite_key
        sql: CONCAT(column_a, '-', column_b, '-', column_c)
        type: string
        primary_key: true
```

## `Refresh Scheduler Interval Error`

```json
{
  "message": "Refresh Scheduler Interval Error",
  "error": "Previous interval #2 was not finished with 60000 interval"
}
```

Error message above indicates that your refresh worker is overloaded. You probably have
a lot of [tenants](/product/configuration/advanced/multitenancy), a lot of
[pre-aggregations](/product/caching/using-pre-aggregations) to refresh, or both.

**If you're using [multitenancy](/product/configuration/advanced/multitenancy), you'd need
to deploy several Cube clusters (each one per a reduced set of tenants) so there will be
multiple refresh workers which will work only on a subset of your tenants.**

If you're using Cube Cloud, you can use a [production multi-cluster](/product/deployment/cloud/deployment-types#production-multi-cluster)
that would automatically do this for you.
