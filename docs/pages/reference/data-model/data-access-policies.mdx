# Data access policies

You can use the `access_policy` parameter within [cubes][ref-ref-cubes] and [views][ref-ref-views]
to configure [data access policies][ref-dap] for them.

## Parameters

The `access_policy` parameter should define a list of access policies. Each policy
can be configured using the following parameters:

- [`role`](#role) defines which [data access role][ref-dap-roles] a policy applies
to.
- [`conditions`](#conditions) can be optionally used to specify when a policy
takes effect.
- [`member_level`](#member-level) and [`row_level`](#row-level) are used to
configure [member-level][ref-dap-mls] and [row-level][ref-dap-rls] access.

### `role`

The `role` parameter defines which [data access role][ref-dap-roles], as defined
by the [`context_to_roles`][ref-context-to-roles] configuration parameter, a
policy applies to. To define a policy that applies to all users regardless of
their roles, use the _any role_ shorthand: `role: "*"`.

In the following example, three access policies are defined, with the first one
applying to all users and two other applying to users with `marketing` or
`finance` roles, respectively.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    access_policy:
      - role: "*"
        # ...

      - role: marketing
        # ...

      - role: finance
        # ...
```

### `conditions`

The optional `conditions` parameter, when present, defines a list of conditions
that should all be `true` in order for a policy to take effect. Each condition is
configured with an `if` parameter that is expected to reference the security
context via an [inline expression][ref-python-inline-expressions].

TODO: JavaScript??? Maybe it should be in Syntax, not in Python.

In the following example, a permissive policy for all roles will only apply to
EMEA-based users, as determined by the `is_EMEA_based` attribute in the security
context:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    access_policy:
      - role: "*"
        conditions:
          - if: "{ securityContext.is_EMEA_based }"
        member_level:
          includes: "*"
```
You can use the `conditions` parameter to define multiple policies for the same
role.

In the following example, the first policy provides access to a _subset of members_
to managers who are full-time employees while the other one provides access to
_all members_ to managers who are full-time employees and have also completed a
data privacy training:


```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...
    access_policy:
      - role: manager
        conditions:
          - if: "{ securityContext.is_full_time_employee }"
        member_level:
          includes:
            - status
            - count
      - role: manager
        conditions:
          - if: "{ securityContext.is_full_time_employee }"
          - if: "{ securityContext.has_completed_privacy_training }"
        member_level:
          includes: "*"
```

### `member_level`

The optional `member_level` parameter, when present, configures [member-level
access][ref-dap-mls] for a policy. You can provide the lists of allowed and
disallowed members with `includes` and `excludes` parameters, respectively.
You can also use the _all members_ shorthand with both of these paramaters:
`includes: "*"`, `excludes: "*"`.

In the following example, member-level access is configured this way:

| Users | Accessible members |
| --- | --- |
| Users with the `admin` role | All members except for `count` |
| Users with the `manager` role | All members except for `count` |
| Users with the `observer` role | All members except for `count` and `count_7d` |
| Users with the `guest` role | Only the `count_30d` measure |
| All other users | No access to this cube at all |

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...
    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
        public: false
      - name: count_7d
        type: count
        rolling_window:
          trailing: 7 days
      - name: count_30d
        type: count
        rolling_window:
          trailing: 30 days
    access_policy:
      - role: "*"
        member_level:
          includes: []
      
      - role: admin
      
      - role: manager
        member_level:
          includes: "*"
      
      - role: observer
        member_level:
          excludes:
            - count_7d
      
      - role: guest
        member_level:
          includes:
            - count_30d
```

Note that access policies respect [member-level security][ref-mls] restrictions
configured via `public` parameters. See [member-level access][ref-dap-mls] to
learn more about policy evaluation.
