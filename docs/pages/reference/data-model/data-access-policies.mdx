# Data access policies

You can use the `access_policy` parameter within [cubes][ref-ref-cubes] and [views][ref-ref-views]
to configure [data access policies][ref-dap] for them.

## Parameters

The `access_policy` parameter should define a list of access policies. Each policy
can be configured using the following parameters:

- [`role`](#role) defines which [data access role][ref-dap-roles] a policy applies
to.
- [`conditions`](#conditions) can be optionally used to specify when a policy
takes effect.
- [`member_level`](#member-level) and [`row_level`](#row-level) parameters are used
to configure [member-level][ref-dap-mls] and [row-level][ref-dap-rls] access.

### `role`

The `role` parameter defines which [data access role][ref-dap-roles], as defined
by the [`context_to_roles`][ref-context-to-roles] configuration parameter, a
policy applies to. To define a policy that applies to all users regardless of
their roles, use the _any role_ shorthand: `role: "*"`.

In the following example, three access policies are defined, with the first one
applying to all users and two other applying to users with `marketing` or
`finance` roles, respectively.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    access_policy:
        # Applies to any role
      - role: "*"
        # ...

      - role: marketing
        # ...

      - role: finance
        # ...
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  access_policy: [
    {
      // Applies to any role
      role: `*`,
      // ...
    },
    {
      role: `marketing`,
      // ...
    },
    {
      role: `finance`,
      // ...
    }
  ]
})
```

</CodeTabs>

### `conditions`

The optional `conditions` parameter, when present, defines a list of conditions
that should all be `true` in order for a policy to take effect. Each condition is
configured with an `if` parameter that is expected to reference the [security
context][ref-sec-ctx].

In the following example, a permissive policy for all roles will only apply to
EMEA-based users, as determined by the `is_EMEA_based` attribute in the security
context:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    access_policy:
      - role: "*"
        conditions:
          - if: "{ securityContext.is_EMEA_based }"
        member_level:
          includes: "*"
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  access_policy: [
    {
      role: `*`,
      conditions: [
        { if: securityContext.is_EMEA_based }
      ],
      member_level: {
        includes: `*`
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</CodeTabs>

You can use the `conditions` parameter to define multiple policies for the same
role.

In the following example, the first policy provides access to a _subset of members_
to managers who are full-time employees while the other one provides access to
_all members_ to managers who are full-time employees and have also completed a
data privacy training:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    access_policy:
      - role: manager
        conditions:
          - if: "{ securityContext.is_full_time_employee }"
        member_level:
          includes:
            - status
            - count

      - role: manager
        conditions:
          - if: "{ securityContext.is_full_time_employee }"
          - if: "{ securityContext.has_completed_privacy_training }"
        member_level:
          includes: "*"
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  access_policy: [
    {
      role: `manager`,
      conditions: [
        { if: securityContext.is_full_time_employee }
      ],
      member_level: {
        includes: [
          `status`,
          `count`
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      role: `manager`,
      conditions: [
        { if: securityContext.is_full_time_employee },
        { if: securityContext.has_completed_privacy_training }
      ],
      member_level: {
        includes: `*`
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</CodeTabs>

### `member_level`

The optional `member_level` parameter, when present, configures [member-level
access][ref-dap-mls] for a policy by specifying allowed or disallowed members.

You can either provide a list of allowed members with the `includes` parameter,
or a list of disallowed members with the `excludes` parameter. There's also the
_all members_ shorthand for both of these paramaters: `includes: "*"`, `excludes: "*"`.

In the following example, member-level access is configured this way:

| Scope | Access |
| --- | --- |
| Users with the `manager` role | All members except for `count` |
| Users with the `observer` role | All members except for `count` and `count_7d` |
| Users with the `guest` role | Only the `count_30d` measure |
| All other users | No access to this cube at all |

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...
    
    access_policy:
      - role: "*"
        member_level:
          # Includes nothing, i.e., excludes all members
          includes: []
      
      - role: manager
        member_level:
          # Includes all members except for `count`
          excludes:
            - count
      
      - role: observer
        member_level:
          # Includes all members except for `count` and `count_7d`
          excludes:
            - count
            - count_7d
      
      - role: guest
        # Includes only `count_30d`, excludes all other members
        member_level:
          includes:
            - count_30d
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  access_policy: [
    {
      role: `*`,
      // Includes nothing, i.e., excludes all members
      member_level: {
        includes: []
      }
    },
    {
      role: `manager`,
      // Includes all members except for `count`
      member_level: {
        excludes: [
          `count`
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      role: `observer`,
      // Includes all members except for `count` and `count_7d`
      member_level: {
        excludes: [
          `count`,
          `count_7d`
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      role: `guest`,
      // Includes only `count_30d`, excludes all other members
      member_level: {
        includes: [
          `count_30d`
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</CodeTabs>

Note that access policies also respect [member-level security][ref-mls] restrictions
configured via `public` parameters. See [member-level access][ref-dap-mls] to
learn more about policy evaluation.

### `row_level`

The optional `row_level` parameter, when present, configures [row-level
access][ref-dap-rls] for a policy by specifying `filters` that should apply to result set rows.
You can also use the optional `allow_all` parameter to explicitly allow or disallow all rows.

In the following example, users with the `manager` role are allowed to access only
rows that have the `state` dimension matching the state from the [security context][ref-sec-ctx].
All other users are disallowed from accessing any rows at all.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...
    
    access_policy:
      - role: "*"
        row_level:
          allow_all: false
      
      - role: manager
        row_level:
          filters:
            - member: state
              operator: equals
              values: [ "{ securityContext.state }" ]
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  access_policy: [
    {
      role: `*`,
      row_level: {
        allow_all: false
      }
    },
    {
      role: `manager`,
      row_level: {
        filters: [
          {
            member: `state`,
            operator: `equals`,
            values: [ securityContext.state ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</CodeTabs>

For convenience, row filters are configured using the same format as [filters in
REST API][ref-rest-query-filters] queries, allowing to use the same set of
[filter operators][ref-rest-query-ops], e.g., `equals`, `contains`, `gte`, etc.
You can also use `and` and `or` parameters to combine multiple filters into
[boolean logical operators][ref-rest-boolean-ops].

Note that access policies also respect [row-level security][ref-rls] restrictions
configured via the `query_rewrite` configuration option. See [row-level access][ref-dap-rls] to
learn more about policy evaluation.
