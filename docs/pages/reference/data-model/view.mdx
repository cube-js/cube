# Views

Views sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They are useful for defining
metrics, managing governance and data access, and controlling ambiguous join
paths.

## Parameters

### `name`

The `name` parameter serves as the identifier of a view. It must be unique among
_all cubes and views_ within a deployment and follow the [naming
conventions][ref-naming].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {});

```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
```

</CodeTabs>

### `description`

A description of the view allows your team to better understand what its purpose
is. It is a very simple and yet useful tool that gives a hint to everyone and
ensures that data is interpreted correctly by users.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
    description: 14 days rolling count of active users
```

</CodeTabs>

### `meta`

Custom metadata. Can be used to pass any information to the frontend.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  meta: {
    any: `value`
  }
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
    meta:
      any: value

```

</CodeTabs>

### `cubes`

Use `cubes` parameter in view to include exposed cubes in bulk. You can build
your view by combining multiple joined cubes together and specifying the path by
which they should be joined for that particular view.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: base_orders,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `created_date`,
        `total_amount`,
        `total_amount_shipped`,
        `count`,
        `average_order_value`
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.line_items.products,
      includes: [
        {
          name: `name`,
          alias: `product`
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.users,
      prefix: true
      includes: `*`,
      excludes: [
        `company`
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders

    cubes:
      - join_path: base_orders
        includes:
          - status
          - created_date
          - total_amount
          - total_amount_shipped
          - count
          - average_order_value

      - join_path: base_orders.line_items.products
        includes:
          - name: name
            alias: product

      - join_path: base_orders.users
        prefix: true
        includes: "*"
        excludes:
          - company









```

</CodeTabs>

#### `join_path`

When listing cubes to expose, you need to provide a `join_path` parameter.
It uses the "dot notation" to describe the join path: `cube_1.cube_2.cube_3`.

For the root cube of the view, just use the cube name as in the example
above for `base_orders`.

#### `includes` and `excludes`

The other required parameter inside the `cubes` block is `includes`. Use it
to list measures, dimensions, or segments you'd like to include into the view. 

To include all members from a cube, use the "includes all" form: `includes: "*"`.
In that case, you can also use the `excludes` parameter to list members that
you'd like to exclude. 

#### `alias`

Optionally, in case you need to rename some of included members, you can provide
`name` and `alias` parameters.

#### `prefix`

Optionally, if you'd like to prefix exposed measures, dimensions, or segments
with the cube name, you can use the `prefix: true` parameter. It will prefix
them with the cube name, e.g. `users_city`. You can use the `alias` parameter to
specify a custom prefix.

### `public`

<InfoBox>

Prior to v0.33, this parameter was called  `shown`.

</InfoBox>

The `public` property is used to manage the visibility of a view. Valid values
for `public` are `true` and `false`. When set to `false`, this view **cannot**
be queried through the API. Defaults to `true`.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders
    public: false
```

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  public: false,
});
```

</CodeTabs>

You can also use `COMPILE_CONTEXT` for dynamic visibility if necessary, check
out our
[Controlling access to cubes and views ](/guides/recipes/access-control/controlling-access-to-cubes-and-views)
recipe.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`arr`, {
  description: `Annual Recurring Revenue`,
  public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance,

  includes: [revenue.arr, revenue.date, customers.plan],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: arr
    description: Annual Recurring Revenue
    public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance

    includes:
      # Measures
      - revenue.arr
      # Dimensions
      - revenue.date
      - customers.plan
```

</CodeTabs>

To learn more about using `public` to control visibility based on security
context, read the [Controlling access to cubes and views
recipe][ref-recipe-control-access-cubes-views].

### `includes` (deprecated)

<WarningBox>

The top-level `includes` parameter is deprecated and might be removed in
the future. Please always use the `includes` parameter with `cubes` and
`join_path` parameters so you can explicitly control the join path.

</WarningBox>

The top-level `includes` parameter is used to bulk add measures or dimensions
to a view.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  includes: [
    // Measures
    users.rolling_count,

    // Dimensions
    users.city,
    users.created_at,
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users

    includes:
      # Measures
      - users.rolling_count

      # Dimensions
      - users.city
      - users.created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

## Using views with pre-aggregations

Pre-aggregations defined for original Cube members would still work when used in
view queries. Please note that pre-aggregations use the same leaf members
matching algorithm used for Cubes. As a consequence, all measures and dimensions
included in pre-aggregation should be leaf members in order to be matched by
view query.
