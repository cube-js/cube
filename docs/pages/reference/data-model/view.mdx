# Views

Views sit on top of the data graph of [cubes][ref-ref-cubes] and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They are useful for defining
metrics, managing governance and data access, and controlling ambiguous join
paths.

Any view should have the following parameters: [`name`](#name) and [`cubes`](#cubes).

## Parameters

### `name`

The `name` parameter serves as the identifier of a view. It must be unique among
_all cubes and views_ within a deployment and follow the [naming
conventions][ref-naming].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {});

```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
```

</CodeTabs>

### `description`

This parameter provides a human-readable description of a view.
When applicable, it will be displayed in [Playground][ref-playground] and exposed
to data consumers via [APIs and integrations][ref-apis].

A description can give a hint both to your team and end users, making sure they
interpret the data correctly. 

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  description: `14 days rolling count of active users`,
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
    description: 14 days rolling count of active users
```

</CodeTabs>

### `cubes`

Use `cubes` parameter in view to include exposed cubes in bulk. You can build
your view by combining multiple joined cubes together and specifying the path by
which they should be joined for that particular view.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: base_orders,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `created_date`,
        `total_amount`,
        `total_amount_shipped`,
        `count`,
        `average_order_value`
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.line_items.products,
      includes: [
        {
          name: `name`,
          alias: `product`
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.users,
      prefix: true
      includes: `*`,
      excludes: [
        `company`
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders

    cubes:
      - join_path: base_orders
        includes:
          - status
          - created_date
          - total_amount
          - total_amount_shipped
          - count
          - average_order_value

      - join_path: base_orders.line_items.products
        includes:
          - name: name
            alias: product

      - join_path: base_orders.users
        prefix: true
        includes: "*"
        excludes:
          - company









```

</CodeTabs>

#### `join_path`

When listing cubes to expose, you need to provide a `join_path` parameter.
It uses the "dot notation" to describe the join path: `cube_1.cube_2.cube_3`.

For the root cube of the view, just use the cube name as in the example
above for `base_orders`.

#### `includes` and `excludes`

The other required parameter inside the `cubes` block is `includes`. Use it
to list measures, dimensions, or segments you'd like to include into the view. 

To include all members from a cube, use the "includes all" form: `includes: "*"`.
In that case, you can also use the `excludes` parameter to list members that
you'd like to exclude. 

#### `alias`

Optionally, in case you need to rename some of included members, you can provide
`name` and `alias` parameters.

#### `prefix`

Optionally, if you'd like to prefix exposed measures, dimensions, or segments
with the cube name, you can use the `prefix: true` parameter. It will prefix
them with the cube name, e.g. `users_city`. You can use the `alias` parameter to
specify a custom prefix.

### `folders`

The `folders` parameter is used to organize members of a view (e.g., dimensions,
hierarchies, measures, etc.) into logical groups. Folders can contain non-overlapping
subsets of members from a view.

<InfoBox>

Folders display is subject to support in [visualization tools][ref-viz-tools].
Check [APIs & Integrations][ref-apis-support] for details.
You can also preview folders in [Playground][ref-playground].

</InfoBox>

Each folder should specify a human-readable name via the `name` parameter and list
included members via the `includes` parameter:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`customers`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: `users`,
      includes: `*`
    },
    {
      join_path: `users.orders`,
      prefix: true,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `price`,
        `count`
      ]
    }
  ],

  folders: [
    {
      name: `Basic Details`,
      includes: [
        `created_at`,
        `location`,
        `orders_status`,
        `orders_count`
      ]
    },

    {
      name: `Sensitive Details`,
      includes: [
        `name`,
        `gender`
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: customers

    cubes:
      - join_path: users
        includes: "*"

      - join_path: users.orders
        prefix: true
        includes:
          - status
          - price
          - count

    folders:
      - name: Basic Details
        includes:
          - created_at
          - location
          - orders_status
          - orders_count

      - name: Sensitive Details
        includes:
          - name
          - gender
```

</CodeTabs>

### `public`

The `public` parameter is used to manage the visibility of a view. Valid values
for `public` are `true` and `false`. When set to `false`, this view **cannot**
be queried through the API. Defaults to `true`.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders
    public: false
```

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  public: false,
});
```

</CodeTabs>

You can also use `COMPILE_CONTEXT` for dynamic visibility if necessary, check
out our
[Controlling access to cubes and views ](/guides/recipes/access-control/controlling-access-to-cubes-and-views)
recipe.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`arr`, {
  description: `Annual Recurring Revenue`,
  public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance,

  includes: [revenue.arr, revenue.date, customers.plan],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: arr
    description: Annual Recurring Revenue
    public: COMPILE_CONTEXT.security_context.is_finance

    includes:
      # Measures
      - revenue.arr
      # Dimensions
      - revenue.date
      - customers.plan
```

</CodeTabs>

To learn more about using `public` to control visibility based on security
context, read the [Controlling access to cubes and views
recipe][ref-recipe-control-access-cubes-views].

### `meta`

Custom metadata. Can be used to pass any information to the frontend.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  meta: {
    any: `value`
  }
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users
    meta:
      any: value

```

</CodeTabs>

### `includes` (deprecated)

<WarningBox>

The top-level `includes` parameter is deprecated and might be removed in
the future. Please always use the `includes` parameter with `cubes` and
`join_path` parameters so you can explicitly control the join path.

</WarningBox>

The top-level `includes` parameter is used to bulk add measures or dimensions
to a view.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`active_users`, {
  includes: [
    // Measures
    users.rolling_count,

    // Dimensions
    users.city,
    users.created_at,
  ],
});
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: active_users

    includes:
      # Measures
      - users.rolling_count

      # Dimensions
      - users.city
      - users.created_at
```
