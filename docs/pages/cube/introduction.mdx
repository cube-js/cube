# Introduction to Cube

Cube is the agentic analytics platform built on top of the [Cube Core](/product/introduction) semantic layer.

## What is Cube?

Cube enables AI agents and users to query, explore, and manipulate data models — transforming the semantic layer into a dynamic, governed workspace for generating insights, automating workflows, and building data products.

Cube is a new generation of BI platform built to be used by both humans and AI agents. It empowers different personas across your organization:

- **Data Engineers** can quickly curate data models with AI assistance, accelerating the development and maintenance of semantic layers
- **Data Analysts** can perform deep analysis with AI assistance, diving into complex data relationships and patterns
- **Business Users** benefit from workbooks and dashboards that Cube can automatically build and maintain
- **AI Agents** can be powered by Cube features through MCP and A2A integrations, enabling automated data discovery, analysis, and reporting workflows

With Cube, you can power copilots, automate data workflows, and create interactive analytics experiences—all grounded in a consistent and governed data model.
