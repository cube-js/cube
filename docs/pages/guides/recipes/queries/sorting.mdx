# Implementing custom sorting

In this recipe, you will learn how to sort the result set of a [query][ref-queries]
by your custom criteria.

## Use case

While [data APIs][ref-data-apis] provide built-in ways to sort the result set by
dimensions and measures in ascending or descending order, sometimes you may need
more flexibility.

For example, if a measure or a dimension contains `NULL` values, they will always
appear last last when sorting in the ascending order. This recipe shows how to
work around this behavior for all data APIs.

Currently, the SQL API does not support `ORDER BY ... NULLS FIRST/LAST`.

## Data modeling

Consider the following data model:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: sort_nulls
    sql: >
      SELECT 1234 AS value UNION ALL
      SELECT 5678 AS value UNION ALL
      SELECT NULL AS value

    dimensions:
      - name: value
        sql: value
        type: number

      - name: value_for_sorting
        sql: "COALESCE({value}, 0)"
        type: number
```

```javascript
cube(`sort_nulls`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT 1234 AS value UNION ALL
    SELECT 5678 AS value UNION ALL
    SELECT NULL AS value
  `,

  dimensions: {
    value: {
      sql: `value`,
      type: `number`
    },

    value_for_sorting: {
      sql: `COALESCE(${value}, 0)`,
      type: `number`
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

You can see that the `value` dimension contains `NULL` values while the
`value_for_sorting` dimension never has `NULL` values. It means that sorting by
the latter dimension will always strictly follow the ascending or descending
order.

Moreover, note that this additional dimension that acts as a *sorting key* may
reference more than one other dimension, allowing to move your complex sorting
logic from the querying layer to your data model. 


## Query

Let's query the `value` dimension and sort the result set by that dimension in
the ascending order:

<CodeTabs>

```sql
SELECT value
FROM sort_nulls
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 ASC;
```

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    "sort_nulls.value"
  ],
  "order": {
    "sort_nulls.value": "asc"
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

We'll get the following result set:

| value  | 
| ------ |
| 1234   |
| 5678   |
| `NULL` |


Now, let's query the `value` dimension but sort the result set by the
`value_for_sorting` dimension in the ascending order:

<CodeTabs>

```sql
SELECT value, value_for_sorting
FROM sort_nulls
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 ASC;
```

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    "sort_nulls.value",
    "sort_nulls.value_for_sorting"
  ],
  "order": {
    "sort_nulls.value_for_sorting": "asc"
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

We'll get the following result set:

| value  | value_for_sorting | 
| ------ | ----------------- |
| `NULL` |                 0 |
| 1234   |              1234 |
| 5678   |              5678 |

As you can see, now `NULL` values of the `value` dimension appear first in the
result set.
