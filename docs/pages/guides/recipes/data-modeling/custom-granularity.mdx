# Implementing custom time dimension granularities

This recipe shows examples of commonly used [custom
granularities][ref-custom-granularities].

## Use case

Sometimes, you might need to group the result set by units of time that are
different from [default granularities][ref-default-granularities] such as `week`
(starting on Monday) or `year` (starting on January 1).

Below, we explore the following examples of custom granularities:
* *Week starting on Sunday*, commonly used in the US and some other countries.
* *[Fiscal year][wiki-fiscal-year]* and *fiscal quarter*, commonly used in
accounting and financial reporting.

## Data modeling

Consider the following data model. `interval` and `offset` parameters are used to
configure each custom granularity in `granularities`.

Note that custom granularities are also exposed via [proxy
dimensions][ref-proxy-granularity] so that we can conveniently query them via
[Playground][ref-playground] or BI tools connected via the [SQL API][ref-sql-api].
We can also use them in further calculations like rendering `fiscal_quarter_label`.
