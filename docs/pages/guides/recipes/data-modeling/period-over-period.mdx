# Calculating period-over-period changes

## Use case

Often, there's a need to calculate a period-over-period change in a
metric, e.g., week-over-week or month-over-month growth of clicks, orders,
revenue, etc.

## Data modeling

In Cube, calculating a period-over-period metric involves the following
steps:
- Define a couple of [`rolling_window` measures][ref-rolling-window] with
different windows, i.e., one for _this period_ and the other for the
_previous period_.
- Define a [calculated measure][ref-calculated-measure] that references
these `rolling_window` measures and uses them in a calculation, e.g.,
divides or subtracts them.

Tesseract, the [next-generation data modeling engine][link-tesseract],
provides a more efficient way to calculate [period-over-period changes][link-period-over-period].
Tesseract is currently in preview. Use the `CUBEJS_TESSERACT_SQL_PLANNER`
environment variable to enable it.

The following data model allows to calculate a month-over-month change of
some value. `current_month_sum` and `previous_month_sum` measures define
two rolling windows and the `month_over_month_ratio` measure divides
their values:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: month_over_month
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS value, '2024-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS value, '2024-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS value, '2024-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date UNION ALL
      SELECT 4 AS value, '2024-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date UNION ALL
      SELECT 5 AS value, '2024-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date UNION ALL
      SELECT 6 AS value, '2024-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date UNION ALL
      SELECT 7 AS value, '2024-04-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date UNION ALL
      SELECT 8 AS value, '2024-04-01'::TIMESTAMP AS date

    dimensions:
      - name: date
        sql: date
        type: time

    measures:
      - name: current_month_sum
        sql: value
        type: sum
        rolling_window:
          trailing: 1 month
          offset: end

      - name: previous_month_sum
        sql: value
        type: sum
        rolling_window:
          trailing: 1 month
          offset: start

      - name: month_over_month_ratio
        sql: "{current_month_sum} / {previous_month_sum}"
        type: number
```

## Result

Often, when calculating period-over-period changes, you would also use a
query with a time dimension and [granularity][ref-time-dimension-granularity]
that matches the period, i.e., `month` for month-over-month calculations:

```json
{
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "month_over_month.date",
      "granularity": "month",
      "dateRange": "this year"
    }
  ],
  "measures": [
    "month_over_month.current_month_sum",
    "month_over_month.previous_month_sum",
    "month_over_month.change"
  ]
}
```

Here's the result:
