# Calculating filtered aggregates

## Use case

Sometimes, there's a need to calculate an aggregation over facts in a joined cube that
is filtered by a dimension from another cube. For example, you might want to calculate
the total sales for a retailer. Each retailer has multiple stores, and each store does
its own sales.

If you set sales goals at the retailer level and are only interested in
the sales that happened after a certain date, you would need to calculate the total sales
in a way that only includes sales that happened after that date.

## Data modeling

We can model this scenario by creating a cube for each entity: `retailer`, `store`,
and `sales`. The `retailer` cube has a one-to-many relationship with the `store` cube,
and the `store` cube has a one-to-many relationship with the `sales` cube:

```yml
cubes:
  - name: retailer
    sql: >
      SELECT 101 AS id, 'Retailer 1' AS name, 10 AS sales_goal, '2025-02-01Z'::TIMESTAMP AS goal_start UNION ALL
      SELECT 102 AS id, 'Retailer 2' AS name, 10 AS sales_goal, '2025-02-01Z'::TIMESTAMP AS goal_start UNION ALL
      SELECT 103 AS id, 'Retailer 3' AS name, 10 AS sales_goal, '2025-02-01Z'::TIMESTAMP AS goal_start

    joins:
      - name: store
        sql: '{CUBE.id} = {store.retailer_id}'
        relationship: one_to_many

    dimensions:

```

The total sales for a store and total sales for a retailer are calculated via [subquery
dimensions][ref-subquery-dimension]. If you look at the join path (`retailer.store.sales`),
you would see the _upstream flow_ of data: the aggregation over sales is passed from the
`sales` cube to the `store` cube and then to the `retailer` cube.

At the same time, the `goal_start` date is passed from the `retailer` cube to the `store`
cube and then to the `sales` cube, creating the _downstream flow_ of data. This way, the
`total_sales_for_goal` measure in the `sales` cube can be filtered by the `goal_start` date.

This pattern of passing measures (aggregates) _upstream_ by the join path and passing
dimensions _downstream_ is an effective way to solve many data modeling tasks, including
calculating filtered aggregates.


## Result

Querying the `retailer` cube will return the total sales for each retailer and the total
sales for each retailer after the `goal_start` date. The `sales_goal_achieved` measure
will show the ratio of the sales goal that has been achieved:
