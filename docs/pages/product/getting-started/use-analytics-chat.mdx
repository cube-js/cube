# Use analytics chat

Once your initial semantic model is ready, you can start using Cube features: analytics chat, workbooks, dashboards, IDE and more.

## Ask analytics questions in chat

On the home page, you can ask AI questions about your data and receive answers as results tables and charts.

## Explore more

When the AI agent returns a query result in Analytics Chat, click Explore to open that result in an exploration. This allows you to further analyze and visualize the data returned by the AI agent.

## Make changes to data model

The AI agent can create ad-hoc calculations using [Semantic SQL][ref-semantic-sql] directly in the analytics chat. These calculations leverage the full power of SQL to build derived metrics on top of your existing semantic model measures and dimensions. When you need to persist these calculations, simply ask the AI agent to save them to your data model, and it will add them as new measures or dimensions.
