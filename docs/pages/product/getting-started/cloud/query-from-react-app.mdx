# Query from a React app

Cube offers both [REST](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api) and
[GraphQL](/product/apis-integrations/graphql-api) APIs, which can be used to
query data from applications built in React or other frontend frameworks.

You can find your REST API endpoint on the <Btn>Overview</Btn> page. In
development mode, Cube creates an isolated endpoint for testing data model
changes without affecting production. The structure of your REST API endpoint in
development mode should follow the format below.

```yaml
https://<deployment-id>.<region>.cubecloudapp.dev/dev-mode/<dev-branch-name>/cubejs-api/v1
```

To test your REST API from your terminal, you can use [curl](https://curl.se/).
Click on “How to connect your application” next to the REST API, and it will
display a code snippet that you can run in your terminal to test the endpoint
with curl.

Cube offers a frontend JavaScript SDK, as well as a React integration that you
can use in your application.

First, you’ll need to install two packages from `npm`:

- [@cubejs-client/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cubejs-client/core)
- [@cubejs-client/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cubejs-client/react)

Next, initialize `cubeApi` within your application.

Please note that you must sign your request with the correct authentication
token. Cube uses the [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) standard by default
to authenticate requests. You can copy a temporary token from the "How to
connect to your application" modal window. For production use, you must generate
this token from your secret key. You can learn more about this in the
[Authentication & Authorization](/product/auth) section of the documentation.

```jsx
import cube from "@cubejs-client/core";

const cubeApi = cube("your-token", {
  apiUrl:
    "https://<delpoyment-id>.<region>.cubecloudapp.dev/dev-mode/<dev-branch-name>/cubejs-api/v1",
});
```

The Cube React package includes a `CubeProvider` that can be used in your React
application.

```jsx
import { CubeProvider } from "@cubejs-client/react";

<CubeProvider cubeApi={cubeApi}>// your application</CubeProvider>;
```

Finally, you can use the `useCubeQuery` hook to load data from Cube into your
React application.

```jsx
import { useCubeQuery } from '@cubejs-client/react';
...
const { resultSet, isLoading, error, progress } = useCubeQuery({
  "measures": ["orders_view.completed_count"],
	"timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "orders_view.created_at",
      "granularity": "month"
    }
  ]
});
```

with React, please refer to the documentation.
