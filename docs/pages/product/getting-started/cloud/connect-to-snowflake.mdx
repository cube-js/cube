# Connect to Snowflake

In this section, we’ll create a Cube Cloud deployment and connect it to
Snowflake. A deployment represents a data model, configuration, and managed
infrastructure.

To continue with this guide, you'll need to have a Cube Cloud account. If you
don't have one yet, [click here to sign up][cube-cloud-signup] for free.

First, [sign in to your Cube Cloud account][cube-cloud-signin]. Then,
click <Btn>Create Deployment</Btn>:

Give the deployment a name, select the cloud provider and region of your choice,
and click <Btn>Next</Btn>:

Microsoft Azure is available in Cube Cloud on
[Premium](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier. [Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact)
for details.

## Set up a Cube project

Next, click <Btn>Create</Btn> to create a new project from scratch:

## Connect to your Snowflake

The last step is to connect Cube Cloud to Snowflake. First, select it from the
grid:

/>

Then enter your Snowflake credentials:

- **Username:** Your Snowflake username. Please note, it is usually **not** your
  email address.
- **Password:** Your Snowflake password.
- **Database:** `CUBE_DEMO`, that is the database we've created in the previous
  step.
- **Account:** Your snowflake account identifier. You can find it in your
  Snowflake URL as the `account_locator` part.
- **Region:** Your Snowflake account region. You can find it in your Snowflake
  URL. If your URL includes a `cloud` part, use both the `cloud_region_id` and
  `cloud` together e.g. `us-east-2.aws`, otherwise just use `cloud_region_id`
- **Warehouse:** `CUBE_DEMO_WH`, that is the warehouse we've created in the
  previous step.
- **Role:** You can leave it blank.

Click <Btn>Apply</Btn>, Cube Cloud will test the connection and proceed to the
next step.

## Generate data model from your Snowflake schema

Cube can now generate a basic data model from your data warehouse schema, which
helps getting started with data modeling faster. Select all four tables in our
`ECOM` schema and click through the data model generation wizard. We'll inspect
these generated files in the next section and start making changes to them.
