<InfoBox heading="Getting Started with Cube Cloud">

[Join our Cube Cloud Office Hours on August 23rd](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4314738/57FE0F7DCCEA887295E4BCD818061E2B?partnerref=docs)
to jumpstart your Cube Cloud account and gain insights on connecting data
sources, creating data models, and integrating your data apps.

The following steps will guide you through setting up a Snowflake account and
uploading the demo dataset, which is stored as CSV files in a public S3 bucket.

First, let’s create a warehouse, database, and schema. Paste the following SQL
into the Editor of the Snowflake worksheet and click Run.

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE cube_demo_wh;
CREATE DATABASE cube_demo;
CREATE SCHEMA cube_demo.ecom;
```

We’re going to create four tables in the `ecom` schema and seed them with data
from S3.

First, let’s create `line_items` table. Delete the previous SQL in your Editor
and then run the following command.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cube_demo.ecom.line_items
( id INTEGER,
  order_id INTEGER,
  product_id INTEGER,
  price INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

Clear all the content in the Editor and run the following command to load data
into the `line_items` table.

```sql
COPY INTO cube_demo.ecom.line_items (id, order_id, product_id, price, created_at)
FROM 's3://cube-tutorial/line_items.csv'
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
```

Now, we’re going to repeat these steps for three other tables.

Run the following command to create the `orders` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cube_demo.ecom.orders
( id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  status VARCHAR,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

Run the following command to load data into the `orders` table from S3.

```sql
COPY INTO cube_demo.ecom.orders (id, user_id, status, completed_at, created_at)
FROM 's3://cube-tutorial/orders.csv'
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
```

Run the following command to create the `users` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cube_demo.ecom.users
( id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  city VARCHAR,
  age INTEGER,
  gender VARCHAR,
  state VARCHAR,
  first_name VARCHAR,
  last_name VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

Run the following command to load data into the `users` table.

```sql
COPY INTO cube_demo.ecom.users (id, city, age, gender, state, first_name, last_name, created_at)
FROM 's3://cube-tutorial/users.csv'
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
```

Run the following command to create the `products` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cube_demo.ecom.products
( id INTEGER,
  name VARCHAR,
  product_category VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

Run the following command to load data into the `products` table.

```sql
COPY INTO cube_demo.ecom.products (id, name, created_at, product_category)
FROM 's3://cube-tutorial/products.csv'
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
```
