# Create workbooks and dashboards

Workbooks are places to curate and organize your analysis. You can create multiple reports using tabs, each focusing on different aspects of your data.

## Create a new workbook

You can create a new workbook in two ways:

- Click the **New Workbook** button on the home page or on the workbooks page
- Open **Explore** from Analytics Chat, then convert that exploration into a workbook

## Organize analysis with tabs

Use tabs within a workbook to create different reports. Each tab can contain its own analysis, allowing you to explore various aspects of your data and organize multiple insights in one place. The AI agent can help you build analysis in workbook tabs, creating queries and visualizations based on your questions.

## Share with dashboards

Once you're ready to share your work, you can turn workbooks into [dashboards][ref-dashboards] to organize reports into shareable artifacts. Dashboards let you select and organize reports from your workbooks into polished views for your team and stakeholders. The AI agent can help you create dashboards, manage layout, add filters, and more.


Dashboards can be published to make them accessible to your team. Published dashboards provide stakeholders with direct access to the insights that matter most.
