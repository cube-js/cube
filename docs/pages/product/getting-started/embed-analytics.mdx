# Embed analytics

Cube offers rich options for embedded analytics. You can embed [dashboards][ref-dashboards] and [analytics chat][ref-analytics-chat] as iframes, use the [Analytics Chat API][ref-chat-api] directly to create your own conversational analytics experience, or use [Core Data APIs][ref-core-apis] directly to build custom visualizations, reporting, and dashboarding experiences.

## Embed with iframes

The simplest way to embed Cube content is using iframes. You can embed both dashboards and analytics chat directly into your applications. Cube supports two authentication methods for iframe embedding: [private embedding][ref-private-embedding] for internal use cases and [signed embedding][ref-signed-embedding] for customer-facing applications.

## Use the Chat API

For more control over the conversational analytics experience, you can use the [Analytics Chat API][ref-chat-api] directly. This API-first approach lets you programmatically integrate AI-powered conversations with your data into your applications, giving you full control over the user experience.

## Build custom experiences

If you want complete control over visualizations and user interfaces, you can use [Cube's core APIs][ref-core-apis]—including REST, GraphQL, and SQL APIs—directly. This headless approach enables you to build fully custom visualization, reporting, and dashboarding experiences tailored to your specific needs.
