# Cube Cloud for Excel

Cube Cloud for Excel is the native [Microsoft Excel][ref-excel] add-in for Cube Cloud.

Unlike the [MDX API][ref-mdx-api], it works with Excel on all operating systems,
including macOS, and all platforms, including web and mobile. It doesn't integrate
with the native [PivotTable][link-pivottable] in Excel but provides a custom
[pivot table](#create-reports-via-pivot-table) UI.

<SuccessBox>

Cube Cloud for Excel is available in Cube Cloud on [Enterprise and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.

</SuccessBox>

<WarningBox>

After [installing](#installation) and [authenticating](#authentication) this
add-in, you will be able to [create reports via pivot
table](#create-reports-via-pivot-table) and work with [saved
reports](#work-with-saved-reports).

## Authentication

You need to authenticate Cube Cloud for Excel to retrieve data from Cube Cloud.
To do so, open the sidebar by clicking on the <Btn>Cube Cloud</Btn> button in
the <Btn>Home</Btn> ribbon. Then, click <Btn>Sign in</Btn>.

A modal window with an authentication prompt will appear. Choose the deployments
that you want to work with in Microsoft Excel and click <Btn>Authorize</Btn>.
Once you see the `Access Granted` message, close the modal window.

If you want to revoke the authentication, open the add-in menu and click
<Btn>Sign out</Btn>.

## Create reports via pivot table

To create a report, go to the add-in menu and click <Btn>Create report via pivot
table</Btn>. Then, select a Cube Cloud deployment from the drop-down. Finally,
you can start building a query by selecting a view and its members in the UI that
looks and feels like [Playground][ref-playground].

<InfoBox>

Google Cloud for Excel works only with [views][ref-views], not cubes.

</InfoBox>

Click on members to add them to <Btn>Rows</Btn> and <Btn>Measures</Btn>.
If needed, drag dimensions from <Btn>Rows</Btn> to <Btn>Columns</Btn>. Click on
the funnel buttons to add members to <Btn>Filters</Btn>. Click on <Btn>Ã—</Btn> to
remove members from a query.

/>

Use <Btn>Order</Btn> and <Btn>Filters</Btn> panes below to sort and filter the
data in the report.

If you'd like to move the report to a new location, click on the desired top-left
cell and then confirm with the target button under <Btn>Result location</Btn>.

/>

With every change to your query, Cube Cloud for Excel will update the report on
the sheet after a slight delay. If you'd like to minimize it, consider
implementing [pre-aggregations][ref-pre-aggs].

When your report is ready, you can optionally move it to [saved reports](#work-with-saved-reports)
by clicking <Btn>Save</Btn>.

## Work with saved reports

Go to the add-in menu and click <Btn>View saved reports</Btn> to see a list of
reports.

Click <Btn>Refresh</Btn> to manually refresh the data in the report's location.
Click <Btn>Edit</Btn> to chnage the query or the location.
