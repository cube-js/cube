## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. The Cube MCP Server acts as a bridge between your AI assistant and Cube's analytics platform, allowing you to ask data questions directly from your coding environment.


## Tools Available

- `chat`: Interactive chat with Cube AI agent for analytics and data exploration with streaming real-time responses

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the MCP server, ensure you have:

- **Admin privileges** in your Cube instance
- An active Cube tenant
- Claude Desktop or Cursor installed

### 1. Obtain Required Credentials

You'll need four key pieces of information:

#### `CUBE_API_KEY`

- Go to <Btn>Admin → API Keys</Btn> to create and manage [API keys][ref-api-keys].
- Create a new API key for your Cube organization.

#### `CUBE_TENANT_NAME`

- Your tenant name from the URL (e.g., 'acme' in `https://acme.cubecloud.dev`)

#### `CUBE_AGENT_ID`

- Go to <Btn>Admin → Agent → Click on Agent</Btn> to find the Agent ID

#### `USER_ID`

- Can be the email address of a registered user in your Cube instance
- Or any custom unique identifier for unregistered users
- This helps identify and personalize responses from the AI agent

## Configuration


Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop or Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cube-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@cube-dev/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CUBE_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",

        "USER_ID": "user@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with Cube's AI agent directly from your AI assistant:

- _What are our top-performing products this quarter?_
- _How does customer acquisition compare year-over-year?_
