## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. The Cube MCP Server acts as a bridge between your AI assistant and Cube's analytics platform, allowing you to ask data questions directly from your coding environment.


## Tools Available

- `chat`: Interactive chat with Cube AI agent for analytics and data exploration with streaming real-time responses

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the MCP server, ensure you have:

- **Admin privileges** in your Cube instance
- An active Cube tenant
- Claude Desktop or Cursor installed

### 1. Obtain Required Credentials

You'll need three key pieces of information:

#### `CUBE_CHAT_API_URL`

- Copy the complete Chat API URL from your agent settings (**Chat API URL** field) in <Btn>Admin → Agents → Click on Agent</Btn>
- This is the full endpoint URL for your agent

#### `CUBE_API_KEY`

- Navigate to <Btn>Admin → Agents → Click on Agent → Enable API Key</Btn>

#### `USER_ID`

- A unique identifier for the user (e.g., email address or user ID)
- Used for session settings and personalization

## Configuration


Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop or Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cube-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@cube-dev/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CUBE_CHAT_API_URL": "https://ai.{cloudRegion}.cubecloud.dev/api/v1/public/{accountName}/agents/{agentId}/chat/stream-chat-state",
        "CUBE_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "USER_ID": "user@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with Cube's AI agent directly from your AI assistant:

Ask natural language questions about your data:

- _Show me revenue trends for the last 6 months_
- _What are our top-performing products this quarter?_
- _How does customer acquisition compare year-over-year?_

The server will stream real-time analytics responses with data visualizations and SQL queries.

## How It Works

The MCP server integrates with Cube's [Chat API][ref-chat-api] using API key authentication directly. The Chat API URL should be copied from your agent settings in the Cube admin panel to ensure you're using the correct dynamic endpoint for your deployment.
