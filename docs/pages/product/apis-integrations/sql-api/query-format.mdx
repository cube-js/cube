# Query format in the SQL API

SQL API runs queries in the Postgres dialect that can
reference those tables and columns.

By default since 1.0, the SQL API executes [regular queries][ref-regular-queries],
[queries with post-processing][ref-queries-wpp] and [queries with
pushdown][ref-queries-wpd]. This page explains their format and details if they
are handled differently by the SQL API.

<InfoBox>

Query pushdown in the SQL API is available in public preview.

## Data model mapping

In the SQL API, each cube or view from the [data model][ref-data-model-concepts]
is represented as a table. Measures, dimensions, and segments are represented as
columns in these tables. 

### Cubes and views

Given that you have a cube or a view called `orders`, you can query it as if it's
a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders;
```
### Dimensions

Given that your cube or view has a dimension called `status`, you can reference it
as a column in the `SELECT` clause. Note that you'll also have to add it to the
`GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
SELECT status
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1;
```

### Measures

Given that your cube or view has a measure called `count`, you can reference it
by wrapping with the `MEASURE` aggregate function:

```sql
SELECT MEASURE(count)
FROM orders;
```

The SQL API allows aggregate functions on measures as long as they match measure types.

#### Aggregate functions

The special `MEASURE` function works with measures of any type.
Measure columns can also be aggregated with the following aggregate functions that
correspond to [measure types][ref-measure-types]:

| Measure type in Cube | Aggregate function in an aggregated query |
| --- | --- |
| [`avg`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#avg) | `MEASURE` or `AVG` | 
| [`boolean`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#boolean) | `MEASURE` |
| [`count`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#count) | `MEASURE` or `COUNT` |
| [`count_distinct`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#count_distinct) | `MEASURE` or `COUNT(DISTINCT …)` |
| [`count_distinct_approx`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#count_distinct_approx) | `MEASURE` or `COUNT(DISTINCT …)` |
| [`max`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#max) | `MEASURE` or `MAX` |
| [`min`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#min) | `MEASURE` or `MIN` |
| [`number`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#number) | `MEASURE` or any other function from this table |
| [`string`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#string) | `MEASURE` or `STRING_AGG` |
| [`sum`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#sum) | `MEASURE` or `SUM` |
| [`time`](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#time) | `MEASURE` or `MAX` or `MIN` |

<WarningBox>

If an aggregate function doesn't match the measure type, the following error
will be thrown: `Measure aggregation type doesn't match`.

</WarningBox>

### Segments

Segments are exposed as columns of the [`boolean` type][link-postgres-boolean].
Given that your cube or view has a segment called `is_completed`, you can reference it
as a column in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE is_completed IS TRUE;
```

### Joins

Please [refer to this page](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api/joins) for details
on joins.

## Post-processing and pushdown

Since 1.0 by default, the SQL API executes, [regular queries][ref-regular-queries],
[queries with post-processing][ref-queries-wpp] and [queries with
pushdown][ref-queries-wpd].

### Query post-processing

The following query is performing a `SELECT` from the `orders` cube:

```sql
SELECT
  city,
  SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'shipped'
GROUP BY 1
```

For this query, the SQL API would transform `SELECT` query fragments into a [regular
query][ref-regular-queries]. It can be represented as follows in the REST API query
format:

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    "orders.city"
  ],
  "measures": [
    "orders.amount"
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "member": "orders.status",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": [
        "shipped"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Because of this transformation, not all functions and expressions are supported
in query fragments performing `SELECT` from cube tables. Please refer to the
[SQL API reference][ref-ref-sql-api] to see whether a specific expression or function
is supported and whether it can be used in [selection][link-selection-projection]
(e.g., `WHERE`) or [projection][link-selection-projection] (e.g., `SELECT`) parts
of SQL queries.

For example, the following query won't work because the SQL API can't push down the
`CASE` expression to Cube for processing. It is not possible to translate `CASE`
expressions in measures.

```sql
SELECT
  city,
  MAX(CASE
    WHEN status = 'shipped'
    THEN '2-done'
    ELSE '1-in-progress'
  END) AS real_status,
  SUM(number)
FROM orders
CROSS JOIN users
GROUP BY 1;
```

You can leverage nested queries in cases like this. You can wrap your `SELECT`
statement from a cube table (**inner query**) into another `SELECT` statement
(**outer query**) to perform calculations with expressions like `CASE`.
This outer `SELECT` is **not** part of the SQL query that being rewritten and
thus allows you to use more SQL functions, operators and expressions.

You can rewrite the above query as follows, making sure to wrap the original
`SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT
  city,
  MAX(CASE
    WHEN status = 'shipped' THEN '2-done'
    ELSE '1-in-progress'
  END) real_status,
  SUM(amount) AS total
FROM (
  SELECT
    users.city AS city,
    SUM(number) AS amount,
    orders.status
  FROM orders
  CROSS JOIN users
  GROUP BY 1, 3
) AS inner
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;
--- You can also use CTEs to achieve the same result
```

The above query works because the `CASE` expression is supported in `SELECT`
queries **not** querying cube tables.

### Query pushdown

<WarningBox heading={`🐣  Preview`}>

  Query pushdown is currently in public preview, and the API and behavior may
  change in future versions.
  
  Query pushdown is enabled by default since 1.0 and is controlled by
  `CUBESQL_SQL_PUSH_DOWN` environment variable.

</WarningBox>

<ReferenceBox>

Query pushdown currently has the following limitations:
* No support for [joins between cubes](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/issues/8483).
* No support for [custom aggregations in `number` measures](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/issues/8482).

</ReferenceBox>

Query pushdown provides a safe net for queries that can't be rewritten
into combination of a [regular query][ref-regular-queries] and post-processing.
Such queries' SQL would be transpiled to target database query leveraging
all target database capabilities for data processing.

During the rewrite process, Cube validates that the target database would support transpired SQL queries.
If direct conversion is not possible, different SQL transformation rewrite rules can be applied to achieve successful translation.
Please refer to the [SQL API reference][ref-ref-sql-api] for the list of supported SQL functions and clauses.
Support varies based on the target database.

## Top-down and bottom-up evaluation

Fundamentally, every SQL operation results in a tabular data set.
This is usually referred to as SQL operational closure or bottom-up SQL evaluation.
However, for OLAP queries, most of the time, top-down evaluation is required.
Top-down evaluation is whenever the outermost sub-query operation decides on how measures would be actually evaluated as opposed to
innermost sub-query in case of standard SQL behavior.

To balance between SQL guarantees and OLAP requirements, Cube
- uses top-down evaluation from the innermost aggregation operation down to all ungrouped sub-queries,
- uses bottom-up evaluation from the innermost aggregation tabular result set up to the outermost sub-query.

<WarningBox>

  This behavior is enabled whenever query pushdown is enabled.
  It's enabled by default since 1.0.

</WarningBox>

To drill-down on how this works, let's consider following example date model

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: ECOM.ORDERS

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: ID
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: status
        sql: STATUS
        type: string
        description: The status of the order (completed etc)

      - name: created_at
        sql: "{CUBE}.CREATED_AT"
        type: time

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

      - name: completed_count
        type: count
        filters:
          - sql: "{CUBE}.STATUS = 'completed'"

      - name: completed_percentage
        type: number
        sql: "(100.0 * {CUBE.completed_count} / NULLIF({CUBE.count}, 0))"
        format: percent
```

And the query to the SQL API:

```sql
SELECT id, status, created_at, completed_percentage FROM orders
```

Such a query is considered an ungrouped query and would result in the following result set:

| id       | status    | created_at |  completed_percentage |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1        | shipped   | 2024-01-01 | 0.0                   |
| 2        | completed | 2024-01-01 | 100.0                 |
| 3        | completed | 2024-01-02 | 100.0                 |

On the other hand, a typical query that various BI tools generate:

```sql
SELECT date_trunc('day', created_at), MEASURE(completed_percentage)
FROM (
  SELECT id, status, created_at, completed_percentage FROM orders
) inner_query
GROUP BY 1
```

...would still yield correct results

| date_trunc('day', created_at) |  completed_percentage |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 2024-01-01                    | 50.0                  |
| 2024-01-02                    | 100.0                 |

For this particular query, `inner_query` won't be evaluated as a table.
Instead, Cube would postpone its execution until wrapping `GROUP BY` and would use only `date_trunc('day', created_at)` as a dimension to evaluate `completed_percentage` measure instead of full set of `inner_query` columns `id`,`status` and `created_at`.
To make it possible, Cube keeps track of ungrouped queries and evaluates them only on the first occurrence of a `GROUP BY` query in case there's one.

## Aggregated and non-aggregated queries

SQL API supports two types of queries against *cube tables*: aggregated
(those with `GROUP BY` statement) and non-aggregated (those without).

<InfoBox>

Without query pushdown, queries that Cube runs against your database will always be aggregated,
regardless of whether you use aggregated (with `GROUP BY`) or non-aggregated
queries with the SQL API.
Whenever you enable query pushdown, queries which do not contain `GROUP BY` clause will be executed as ungrouped queries.

</InfoBox>

A non-aggregated query would only include bare column names in SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  status,  -- dimension
  count    -- measure
FROM orders
```

With query pushdown disabled, Cube will still use `GROUP BY` to execute such a query.

<WarningBox>

Automatic use of `GROUP BY` is disabled by default.

</WarningBox>

Whenever query pushdown is enabled, such query would run as ungrouped query.
As with REST API such queries do not use `GROUP BY` and render measures as if those would be grouped by primary key of a cube.

<WarningBox>

If query pushdown is enabled, calculated `number`, `string` or `time` measures queried by SQL API can't use aggregation function definitions with it's `sql` paremeter.
Such measures can still reference other aggregate type measures though.

</WarningBox>

Aggregated query must aggregate all measure columns and group by
all dimension columns. You can use the special `MEASURE` aggregate function
for measures of [any type][ref-measure-types]. This is quite convenient, especially
in case you're manually writing ad-hoc queries:

```sql
SELECT
  status,         -- dimension
  MEASURE(count)  -- measure
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
```

<WarningBox>

If any measure columns are not aggregated or any dimension columns aren't included
in `GROUP BY`, the following error will be thrown: `Projection references
non-aggregate values`. This is a standard SQL consistency check for the `GROUP BY`
operation, and it's enforced by the SQL API as well. 

</WarningBox>

## Filtering

Without query pushdown, Cube supports most simple equality operators like
`=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` as well as `IN` and `LIKE` operators.
Cube tries to push down all filters into a [regular query][ref-regular-queries].
In some cases, filtering can only be done during [post-processing][ref-queries-wpp].
Time dimension filters will be converted to time dimension date ranges whenever
it's possible.

## Ordering

Without query pushdown, Cube tries to push down all `ORDER BY` statements into
a [regular query][ref-regular-queries].

### Row limit edge case

If the `ORDER BY` statement can't be pushed down, ordering would be performed during
[post-processing][ref-queries-wpp]. If there are more than [50,000 rows][ref-query-default-limit]
in the result set, this can yield incorrect results.

However, given that queries to Cube are usually aggregated, this is a very rare case;
anyway, please keep this limitation in mind when designing your queries.

Consider the following query. Because of the `SUM(total_value) + 2` expression
in the projection of the outer query, thr SQL API can't push down `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT
  status,
  SUM(total_value) + 2 AS transformed_amount
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM orders
) AS orders
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY status DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

You can use `EXPLAIN` against the above query to look at the query plan.
As you can see, the sorting operation is done after the regular query and the projection:

```bash
+ GlobalLimitExec: skip=None, fetch=100
+- SortExec: [transformed_amount@1 DESC]
+-- ProjectionExec: expr=[status@0 as status, SUM(orders.total_value)@1 + CAST(2 AS Float64) as transformed_amount]
+--- CubeScanExecutionPlan
```
