<Btn>Cube Cloud for Sheets</Btn> menu item:

## Authentication

You need to authenticate Cube Cloud for Sheets to retrieve data from your
semantic layer in Cube Cloud. To do so, open the sidebar by going to the
<Btn>Extensions</Btn> menu and choosing <Btn>Cube Cloud for Sheets → Open
Sidebar</Btn>. Then, click <Btn>Sign in</Btn>.

/>

A modal window with an authentication prompt will open. Choose the deployments
within your Cube Cloud account that you want to work with in Google Sheets and
click <Btn>Authorize</Btn>. Once you see the `Access Granted` message, close the
modal window.

If you want to revoke the authentication, open the add-on menu and click
<Btn>Sign out</Btn>.

## Create reports via pivot table

To create a report, go to the add-on menu and click <Btn>Create report via pivot
table</Btn>. Then, select a Cube Cloud deployment from the drop-down. Finally,
you can start building a query by selecting a view and its members in the UI that
looks and feel exactly like [Playground][ref-playground].

<InfoBox>

Google Cloud for Sheets only works with [views][ref-views] rather than cubes.

</InfoBox>

Click on members to add them to <Btn>Rows</Btn> and <Btn>Measures</Btn>.
If needed, drag dimensions from <Btn>Rows</Btn> to <Btn>Columns</Btn>. Click on
the funnel buttons to add members to <Btn>Filters</Btn>. Click on <Btn>×</Btn> to
remove members from a query.

/>

Use <Btn>Order</Btn> and <Btn>Filters</Btn> panes below to sort and filter the
data in the report.

If you'd like to move the report to a new location, click on the desired top-left
cell and then confirm with the target button under <Btn>Result location</Btn>.

/>

With every change to your query, Cube Cloud for Sheets will update the report on
the sheet after a slight delay. If you'd like to minimize it, consider
implementing [pre-aggregations][ref-pre-aggs].

When your report is ready, you can optionally move it to [saved reports](#work-with-saved-reports)
by clicking <Btn>Save</Btn>.

## Work with saved reports

Go to the add-on menu and click <Btn>View saved reports</Btn> to see a list of
reports.

Click <Btn>Refresh</Btn> to manually refresh the data in the report's location.
Click <Btn>Edit</Btn> to chnage the query or the location.
