# AI API

The AI API provides a standard interface for interacting with large language models (LLMs) as a turnkey solution for text-to-semantic layer queries.

Specifically, you can send the AI API a message (or conversation of messages) and it will return a Cube REST API query. Optionally, it will also run the query and return the results.

<WarningBox>
  The AI API is available on [Cube
  Cloud](/getting-started#getting-started-with-cube-cloud) only. It is currently
  in preview and should not be used for production workloads. Please contact
  your Cube representative to have it enabled for your account.
</WarningBox>

See [AI API reference][ref-ref-ai-api] for the list of supported API endpoints.

## Configuration

While the AI API is in preview, your Cube account team will enable and configure it for you.

If you wish to enable or disable the AI API on a specific Cube deployment, you may do so by going to "Settings" in the Cube Cloud sidebar, then "Configuration", and then toggling the "AI API" configuration flag switch.

To find your AI API endpoint in Cube Cloud, go to the <Btn>Overview</Btn> page,
click <Btn>API credentials</Btn>, and choose the <Btn>AI API</Btn> tab.

## Getting Started

### Data modeling

The AI API currently requires [views](/reference/data-model/view) in order to generate queries. This is because:

1. Views let you create carefully-curated datasets, resulting in better outputs from LLMs. That is, you can choose exactly what is "ready" for the AI to see and what is not.
2. Views define deterministic joins between Cubes, so the LLM does not have to "guess" at join ordering

To use the AI API, set up one or more views before getting started.

<InfoBox>
  By default, the AI API syncs data model changes hourly. To manually trigger a
  sync, go to "Settings" in the Cube Cloud sidebar, then "Data Catalog
  Services", then hit "Sync" on the Cube connection.
</InfoBox>

### Authentication

Authentication works the same as for the [REST API](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api#authentication).

The API Token is passed via the Authorization Header. The token itself is a
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io), the [Security section](/product/auth) describes
how to generate it.

### Example request

Given the data model from the ["data modeling" section](#data-modeling) above, you could send a request with the following body:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Where do we have the highest aov this year?"
    }
  ]
}
```

Based on the view(s) provided, the AI API generates a Cube REST API request that could be used to answer the user's question. For example, you might receive the following response:

```json
{
  "message": "To find where we have the highest Average Order Value (AOV) this year, we can analyze the data by comparing the AOV across different dimensions such as cities or states.",
  "cube_query": {
    "measures": ["orders_view.average_order_value"],
    "dimensions": ["orders_view.users_city"],
    "timeDimensions": [
      {
        "dimension": "orders_view.created_at",
        "dateRange": "this year"
      }
    ],
    "order": {
      "orders_view.average_order_value": "desc"
    },
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

See [running queries](#running-queries) for details on how to run the Cube query generated.

### Running queries

You have two possible ways to run the query:

#### 1. `runQuery` parameter

Use the `runQuery` request parameter to have the AI API run the query and report results back. When doing this, the request above would become:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Where do we have the highest aov this year?"
    }
  ],
  "runQuery": true
}
```

The response will be the same as above, followed by a second JSON object representing the response (see the [REST API reference](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api/reference#v1load) for its format).

<InfoBox>
  Note that the response now contains two JSON objects separated by a newline
  (`\n`). You are responsible for parsing these appropriately.
</InfoBox>

#### 2. `/load`

Alternatively, you may take the generated `cube_query` from the response and then call the [REST API `/load` endpoint](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api/reference#v1load) with it in the `/load` request body. This is recommended for advanced use-cases where you need more control over formatting, pagination, etc. or if you are adding the AI API to an existing Cube REST API implementation.

### Error Handling

Occasionally you may encounter errors. There are a few common categories of errors:

#### 1. Cannot answer question

If the AI API is unable to generate a query because the view(s) in your data model do not have the appropriate fields to answer the question, you will receive a message like the following, and no `cube_query` in the response:

```
{
    "message": "I'm sorry, but the current data modeling doesn't cover stock prices or specific company data like NVDA. I will notify the data engineering team about this request."
}
```

#### 2. Invalid query

Occasionally, the AI API may generate a query that is invalid or cannot be run. When this happens, you will receive an error upon running the query.

One way of handling this is to pass the error message back into the AI API; it may then self-correct and provide a new, valid query.

#### 3. Continue wait

When using `"runQuery": true`, you might sometimes receive a query result containing `{ "error": "Continue wait" }`. If this happens, you should use `/load` ([described above](#2-load)) instead of `runQuery` to run the query, and handle retries as described in the [REST API documentation](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api#continue-wait).

## Advanced Usage

<InfoBox>
    The advanced features discussed here are available on Cube version 1.1.7 and above.
</InfoBox>

### Custom prompts

You can prompt the AI API with custom instructions. For example, you may want it to always
respond in a particular language, or to refer to itself by a name matching your brand.
Custom prompts also allow you to give the model more context on your company and data model,
for example if it should usually prefer a particular view.

To use a custom prompt, set the `CUBE_CLOUD_AI_API_PROMPT` environment variable in your deployment.

<InfoBox>
  Custom prompts add to, rather than overwrite, the AI API's existing prompting, so you
  do not need to re-write instructions around how to generate the query itself.
</InfoBox>

### Meta tags

The AI API can read [meta tags](/reference/data-model/view#meta) on your dimensions, measures, 
segments, and views.

Use the `ai` meta tag to give context that is specific to AI and goes beyond what is 
included in the description. This can have any keys that you want. For example, you can use it
to give the AI context on possible values in a categorical dimension:
```yaml
      - name: status
        sql: status
        type: string
        meta:
          ai:
            values:
              - shipped
              - processing
              - completed
```

### Value search

By default, the AI API has no ability to see the contents of your data (for privacy reasons).
However, this makes it difficult for the AI API to generate correct filters for some queries.

Imagine you have a categorical `order_status` dimension with the possible values "shipped",
"processing", and "completed". Without value search, asking "how many complete orders did
we have today" might get you a query filtering on `order_status = 'Complete'` instead of
the correct `order_status = 'completed'`.

To solve this, the AI API can perform "value searches" where it introspects the values in
selected categorical dimensions before running a query. Value search is opt-in and dimensions
must be enabled for it individually. Currently, the AI API performs value search by running
Cube queries using the `contains` filter operator against one or more chosen dimensions.
The LLM will select dimensions from among those you have based on the question asked and
generate possible values dynamically.

<InfoBox>
  When running value search queries, the AI API passes through the security context used
  for the AI API request, so security is maintained and only dimensions the end user has
  access to are able to be searched.
</InfoBox>

To enable value search on a dimension, set the `searchable` field to true under the `ai`
meta tag, as shown below:
```yaml
    - name: order_status
      sql: order_status
      type: string
      meta:
        ai:
          searchable: true
```

Note that enabling Value Search may lead to slightly longer AI API response times when it
is used but should result in significantly more accurate queries in many situations. Value
Search can only be used on string dimensions.

### Other LLM providers

<InfoBox>
  These environment variables also apply to the [AI Assistant](/product/workspace/ai-assistant),
  if it is enabled on your deployment.
</InfoBox>

If desired, you may "bring your own" LLM model by providing a model and API credentials
for a supported model provider. Do this by setting environment variables in your Cube
deployment.

- `CUBE_CLOUD_AI_COMPLETION_MODEL` - The AI model name to use (varies based on provider). For example `gpt-4o`.
- `CUBE_CLOUD_AI_COMPLETION_PROVIDER` - The provider. Must be one of the following:
