# Query format in the REST API

Queries to the REST API are plain JavaScript objects, describing an analytics
query. The basic elements of a query (query members) are `measures`, `dimensions`,
and `segments`.

The query member format name is `cube_name.member_name`, for example the `email`
dimension in the `users` cube would have the `users.email` name.

In the case of a dimension of the `time` type, a granularity could be optionally
added to the name, in the following format: `cube_name.time_dimension_name.granularity_name`,
e.g., `stories.time.week`. It can be one of the [default granularities][ref-default-granularities]
(e.g., `year` or `week`) or a [custom granularity][ref-custom-granularities].

The Cube client also accepts an array of queries. By default, it will be treated
as a Data Blending query type.

## Query Properties

A Query has the following properties:

- `measures`: An array of measures.
- `dimensions`: An array of dimensions.
- `filters`: An array of objects, describing filters. Learn about
  [filters format](#filters-format).
- `timeDimensions`: A convenient way to specify a time dimension with a filter.
  It is an array of objects in [timeDimension format.](#time-dimensions-format)
- `segments`: An array of segments. A segment is a named filter, created in the
  data model.
- `limit`: A [row limit][ref-row-limit] for your query.
- `total`: If set to `true`, Cube will run a [total query][ref-total-query] and
return the total number of rows as if no row limit or offset are set in the query.
The default value is `false`.
- `offset`: The number of initial rows to be skipped for your query. The default
  value is `0`.
- `order`: An object, where the keys are measures or dimensions to order by and
  their corresponding values are either `asc` or `desc`. The order of the fields
  to order on is based on the order of the keys in the object. If not provided,
  [default ordering][ref-default-order] is applied. If an empty object (`[]`) is
  provided, no ordering is applied.
- `timezone`: A [time zone][ref-time-zone] for your query. You can set the
desired time zone in the [TZ Database Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database)
format, e.g., `America/Los_Angeles`.
- `renewQuery`: If `renewQuery` is set to `true`, Cube will renew all
  [`refreshKey`][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refreshkey] for queries and query
  results in the foreground. However, if the
  [`refreshKey`][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refreshkey] (or
  [`refreshKey.every`][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refreshkey-every]) doesn't
  indicate that there's a need for an update this setting has no effect. The
  default value is `false`.
  > **NOTE**: Cube provides only eventual consistency guarantee. Using a small
  > [`refreshKey.every`][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-refreshkey-every] value together
  > with `renewQuery` to achieve immediate consistency can lead to endless
  > refresh loops and overall system instability.
- `ungrouped`: If set to `true`, Cube will run an [ungrouped
query][ref-ungrouped-query].

```json
{
  "measures": ["stories.count"],
  "dimensions": ["stories.category"],
  "filters": [
    {
      "member": "stories.isDraft",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": ["No"]
    }
  ],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "stories.time",
      "dateRange": ["2015-01-01", "2015-12-31"],
      "granularity": "month"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 50,
  "order": {
    "stories.time": "asc",
    "stories.count": "desc"
  },
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
}
```

### Default order

If the `order` property is not specified in the query, Cube sorts results by
default using the following rules:

- The first time dimension with a granularity, ascending. If no time dimension
  with a granularity exists...
- The first measure, descending. If no measure exists...
- The first dimension, ascending.

### Alternative order format

Also you can control the ordering of the `order` specification, Cube support
alternative order format - array of tuples:

```json
{
  "order": [
      ["stories.time", "asc"],
      ["stories.count", "asc"]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Filters Format

A filter is a JavaScript object with the following properties:

- `member`: Dimension or measure to be used in the filter, for example:
  `stories.isDraft`. See below on difference between filtering dimensions vs
  filtering measures.
- `operator`: An operator to be used in the filter. Only some operators are
  available for measures. For dimensions the available operators depend on the
  type of the dimension. Please see the reference below for the full list of
  available operators.
- `values`: An array of values for the filter. Values must be of type String. If
  you need to pass a date, pass it as a string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### Filtering Dimensions vs Filtering Measures

Filters are applied differently to dimensions and measures.

When you filter on a dimension, you are restricting the raw data before any
calculations are made. When you filter on a measure, you are restricting the
results after the measure has been calculated.

## Filters Operators

Only some operators are available for measures. For dimensions, the available
operators depend on the
[type of the dimension](/reference/data-model/types-and-formats#dimension-types).

### `equals`

Use it when you need an exact match. It supports multiple values.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `string`, `number`, `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "users.country",
  "operator": "equals",
  "values": ["US", "Germany", "Israel"]
}
```

<InfoBox>

If you would like to check if a value is `NULL`, use the [`notSet`](#notset)
operator instead.

</InfoBox>

### `notEquals`

The opposite operator of `equals`. It supports multiple values.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `string`, `number`, `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "users.country",
  "operator": "notEquals",
  "values": ["France"]
}
```

<InfoBox>

If you would like to check if a value is not `NULL`, use the [`set`](#set)
operator instead.

</InfoBox>

### `contains`

The `contains` filter acts as a wildcard case-insensitive `LIKE` operator. In
the majority of SQL backends it uses `ILIKE` operator with values being
surrounded by `%`. It supports multiple values.

- Dimension types: `string`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.title",
  "operator": "contains",
  "values": ["serverless", "aws"]
}
```

### `notContains`

The opposite operator of `contains`. It supports multiple values.

- Dimension types: `string`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.title",
  "operator": "notContains",
  "values": ["ruby"]
}
```

This operator adds `IS NULL` check to include `NULL` values unless you add
`null` to `values`. For example:

```json
{
  "member": "posts.title",
  "operator": "notContains",
  "values": ["ruby", null]
}
```

### `startsWith`

The `startsWith` filter acts as a case-insensitive `LIKE` operator with a
wildcard at the end. In the majority of SQL backends, it uses the `ILIKE`
operator with `%` at the end of each value. It supports multiple values.

- Dimension types: `string`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.title",
  "operator": "startsWith",
  "values": ["ruby"]
}
```

### `notStartsWith`

The opposite operator of `startsWith`.

### `endsWith`

The `endsWith` filter acts as a case-insensitive `LIKE` operator with a wildcard
at the beginning. In the majority of SQL backends, it uses the `ILIKE` operator with
`%` at the beginning of each value. It supports multiple values.

- Dimension types: `string`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.title",
  "operator": "endsWith",
  "values": ["ruby"]
}
```

### `notEndsWith`

The opposite operator of `endsWith`.

### `gt`

The `gt` operator means **greater than** and is used with measures or dimensions
of type `number`.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.upvotes_count",
  "operator": "gt",
  "values": ["100"]
}
```

### `gte`

The `gte` operator means **greater than or equal to** and is used with measures
or dimensions of type `number`.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.upvotes_count",
  "operator": "gte",
  "values": ["100"]
}
```

### `lt`

The `lt` operator means **less than** and is used with measures or dimensions of
type `number`.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.upvotes_count",
  "operator": "lt",
  "values": ["10"]
}
```

### `lte`

The `lte` operator means **less than or equal to** and is used with measures or
dimensions of type `number`.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.upvotes_count",
  "operator": "lte",
  "values": ["10"]
}
```

### `set`

Operator `set` checks whether the value of the member **is not** `NULL`. You
don't need to pass `values` for this operator.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`, `string`, `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.author_name",
  "operator": "set"
}
```

### `notSet`

An opposite to the `set` operator. It checks whether the value of the member
**is** `NULL`. You don't need to pass `values` for this operator.

- Applied to measures.
- Dimension types: `number`, `string`, `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.author_name",
  "operator": "notSet"
}
```

### `inDateRange`

<WarningBox>

From a pre-aggregation standpoint, `inDateRange` filter is applied as a generic
filter. All pre-aggregation granularity matching rules aren't applied in this
case. It feels like pre-aggregation isn't matched. However, pre-aggregation is
just missing the filtered time dimension in
[dimensions][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-dimensions] list. If you want date range
filter to match [timeDimension][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-time-dimension] please
use [timeDimensions](#time-dimensions-format) `dateRange` instead.

</WarningBox>

The operator `inDateRange` is used to filter a time dimension into a specific
date range. The values must be an array of dates with the following format
'YYYY-MM-DD'. If only one date specified the filter would be set exactly to this
date.

There is a convenient way to use date filters with grouping -
[learn more about the `timeDimensions` property here](#time-dimensions-format)

- Dimension types: `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.time",
  "operator": "inDateRange",
  "values": ["2015-01-01", "2015-12-31"]
}
```

### `notInDateRange`

<WarningBox>

From a pre-aggregation standpoint, `notInDateRange` filter is applied as a
generic filter. All pre-aggregation granularity matching rules aren't applied in
this case. It feels like pre-aggregation isn't matched. However, pre-aggregation
is just missing the filtered time dimension in
[dimensions][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-dimensions] list.

</WarningBox>

An opposite operator to `inDateRange`, use it when you want to exclude specific
dates. The values format is the same as for `inDateRange`.

- Dimension types: `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.time",
  "operator": "notInDateRange",
  "values": ["2015-01-01", "2015-12-31"]
}
```

### `beforeDate`

<WarningBox>

From a pre-aggregation standpoint, `beforeDate` filter is applied as a generic
filter. All pre-aggregation granularity matching rules aren't applied in this
case. It feels like pre-aggregation isn't matched. However, pre-aggregation is
just missing the filtered time dimension in
[dimensions][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-dimensions] list.

</WarningBox>

Use it when you want to retrieve all results before some specific date. The
values should be an array of one element in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

- Dimension types: `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.time",
  "operator": "beforeDate",
  "values": ["2015-01-01"]
}
```

### `afterDate`

<WarningBox>

From a pre-aggregation standpoint, `afterDate` filter is applied as a generic
filter. All pre-aggregation granularity matching rules aren't applied in this
case. It feels like pre-aggregation isn't matched. However, pre-aggregation is
just missing the filtered time dimension in
[dimensions][ref-schema-ref-preaggs-dimensions] list.

</WarningBox>

The same as `beforeDate`, but is used to get all results after a specific date.

- Dimension types: `time`.

```json
{
  "member": "posts.time",
  "operator": "afterDate",
  "values": ["2015-01-01"]
}
```

### `measureFilter`

The `measureFilter` operator is used to apply an existing measure's filters to
the current query.

This usually happens when you call
[`ResultSet.drilldown()`][ref-client-core-resultset-drilldown], which will
return a query for the drill members. If the original query has a filter on a
measure, that filter will be added as otherwise the drilldown query will lose
that context. Not supported by pre-aggregations.

- Applied to measures.

```json
{
  "member": "Orders.count",
  "operator": "measureFilter"
}
```

## Boolean logical operators

Filters can contain `or` and `and` logical operators. Logical operators have
only one of the following properties:

- `or` An array with one or more filters or other logical operators
- `and` An array with one or more filters or other logical operators

```json
{
  "or": [
    {
      "member": "visitors.source",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": ["some"]
    },
    {
      "and": [
        {
          "member": "visitors.source",
          "operator": "equals",
          "values": ["other"]
        },
        {
          "member": "visitor_checkins.cards_count",
          "operator": "equals",
          "values": ["0"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**You can not put dimensions and measures filters in the same logical operator.**
When Cube generates a SQL query to the data source, dimension and measure filters
are translated to expressions in `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses, respectively.  
In other words, dimension filters apply to raw (unaggregated) data and measure filters
apply to aggregated data, so it's not possible to express such filters in SQL semantics.

## Time Dimensions Format

Since grouping and filtering by a time dimension is quite a common case, Cube
provides a convenient shortcut to pass a dimension and a filter as a
`timeDimension` property.

- `dimension`: Time dimension name.
- `dateRange`: An array of dates with the following format `YYYY-MM-DD` or in
  `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSS` format. Values should always be local and in query
  `timezone`. Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format are also accepted. Such dates are
  padded to the start and end of the day if used in start and end of date range
  interval accordingly. Please note that for timestamp comparison, `>=` and `<=`
  operators are used. It requires, for example, that the end date range date
  `2020-01-01` is padded to `2020-01-01T23:59:59.999`. If only one date is
  specified it's equivalent to passing two of the same dates as a date range.
  You can also pass a string with a [relative date
  range][ref-relative-date-range], for example, `last quarter`.
- `compareDateRange`: An array of date ranges to compare measure values. See
[compare date range queries][ref-compare-date-range] for details.
- `granularity`: A granularity for a time dimension. It can be one of the [default
granularities][ref-default-granularities] (e.g., `year` or `week`) or a [custom
granularity][ref-custom-granularities].
  If you don't provide a granularity, Cube will only perform filtering by a
  specified time dimension, without grouping.

```json
{
  "measures": ["stories.count"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "stories.time",
      "dateRange": ["2015-01-01", "2015-12-31"],
      "granularity": "month"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use [compare date range queries][ref-compare-date-range] when you want
to see, for example, how a metric performed over a period in the past and how it
performs now. You can pass two or more date ranges where each of them is in the
same format as a `dateRange`:

```javascript
// ...
const resultSet = await cubeApi.load({
  measures: ["stories.count"],
  timeDimensions: [
    {
      dimension: "stories.time",
      compareDateRange: ["this week", ["2020-05-21", "2020-05-28"]],
      granularity: "month",
    },
  ],
});
```

### Relative date range

You can also use a string with a relative date range in the `dateRange`
property, for example:

```json
{
  "measures": ["stories.count"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "stories.time",
      "dateRange": "last week",
      "granularity": "day"
    }
  ]
}
```

Some of supported formats:

- `today`, `yesterday`, or `tomorrow`
- `last year`, `last quarter`, or `last 360 days`
- `next month` or `last 6 months` (current date not included)
- `from 7 days ago to now` or `from now to 2 weeks from now` (current date
  included)

<InfoBox>

Cube uses the [Chrono][chrono-website] library to parse relative dates. Please
refer to its documentation for more examples.
