# MDX API

The MDX API enables Cube to connect to [Microsoft Excel][ref-excel]. It derives
its name from [multidimensional data expressions][link-mdx], a query language
for OLAP in the Microsoft ecosystem.

Unlike [Cube Cloud for Excel][ref-cube-cloud-for-excel], it only works with Excel
on Microsoft Windows. However, it allows using the data from the MDX API with the
native [PivotTable][link-pivottable] in Excel.

<SuccessBox>

The MDX API is available in Cube Cloud on [Enterprise and
above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.
It also requires the M [deployment tier](/product/deployment/cloud/pricing#deployment-tiers).

</SuccessBox>

<WarningBox>

The MDX API is currently in preview.

</WarningBox>

Key features:

- <b>Direct connectivity:</b> Connect Excel directly to Cube Cloud using standard XMLA protocols.
- <b>Advanced analytical functions:</b> Utilize the power of MDX to execute sophisticated queries that include slicing, dicing, drilling down, and rolling up of data.
- <b>Real-time access:</b> Fetch live data from Cube Cloud, ensuring that your analyses and reports always reflect the most current information.

## Configuration

<WarningBox>

While the MDX API is in preview, your Cube account team will enable and configure it for you.

</WarningBox>

To enable or disable the MDX API on a specific deployment, go to <Btn>Settings</Btn>
in the Cube Cloud sidebar, then <Btn>Configuration</Btn>, and then toggle the
<Btn>Enable MDX API</Btn> option.

## Using MDX API with Excel

<InfoBox>

The MDX API works only with [views][ref-views], not cubes.

</InfoBox>

The following section describes Excel-specific configuration options.

### Dimension hierarchies

MDX API supports dimension hierarchies. You can define multiple hierarchies.
Each level in the hierarchy is a dimension from the view.

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders_view
    description: "Data about orders, amount, count and breakdown by status and geography."
    meta:
      hierarchies:
        - name: "Geography"
          levels:
            - country
            - state
            - city
```

<InfoBox>

For historical reasons, the syntax shown above differ from how
[hierarchies][ref-hierarchies] are supposed to be defined in the data model.
This is going to be harmonized in the future. 

</InfoBox>

### Dimension keys

You can define a member that will be used as a key for a dimension in the cube's model file.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql_table: USERS
    public: false

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "{CUBE}.ID"
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: first_name
        sql: FIRST_NAME
        type: string
        meta:
          key_member: users_id
```

### Dimension labels

You can define a member that will be used as a label for a dimension in the cube's model file.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql_table: USERS
    public: false

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "{CUBE}.ID"
        type: number
        meta:
          label_member: users_first_name
```

### Custom properties

You can define custom properties for dimensions in the cube's model file.

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql_table: USERS
    public: false

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: "{CUBE}.ID"
        type: number
        meta:
          properties:
            - name: "Property A"
              column: users_first_name
            - name: "Property B"
              value: users_city
```

### Measure groups

MDX API supports organizing measures into groups (folders). You can define measure groups in the view's model file.

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders_view
    description: "Data about orders, amount, count and breakdown by status and geography."
    meta:
      folders:
          - name: "Folder A"
            members:
              - total_amount
              - average_order_value
          - name: "Folder B"
            members:
              - completed_count
              - completed_percentage
```

<InfoBox>

For historical reasons, the syntax shown above differ from how
[folders][ref-folders] are supposed to be defined in the data model.
This is going to be harmonized in the future.

## Authentication and authorization

Authentication and authorization work the same as for the [SQL API](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api/security).
