# MDX API

The MDX (MultiDimensional eXpressions) API provides a robust interface for connecting applications, such as Microsoft Excel, to the Cube Cloud semantic layer via the XMLA (XML for Analysis) standard. 

Key Features:

- <b>Direct connectivity:</b> Connect Excel and other compatible applications directly to Cube Cloud using standard XMLA protocols.
- <b>Advanced analytical functions:</b> Utilize the power of MDX to execute sophisticated queries that include slicing, dicing, drilling down, and rolling up of data.
- <b>Real-time access:</b> Fetch live data from Cube Cloud, ensuring that your analyses and reports always reflect the most current information.

<WarningBox>
  The MDX API is available on [Cube
  Cloud](/getting-started#getting-started-with-cube-cloud) only. It is currently
  in preview.
</WarningBox>

## Configuration

While the MDX API is in preview, your Cube account team will enable and configure it for you.

If you wish to enable or disable the MDX API on a specific Cube deployment, you may do so by going to "Settings" in the Cube Cloud sidebar, then "Configuration", and then toggling the "Enable MDX API" configuration flag switch.

To find your MDX API's credentials along with XMLA endpoint, go to "Settings" in the Cube Cloud sidebar, then "Connections and APIs"

## Using MDX API with Excel

Once MDX API is enabled, you can use it to connect to Cube from Excel. In Excel, go to the **Data tab**, click **Get Data** and select **From Database -> From Analysis Services**.

  Please note that only the [views](/reference/data-model/view) will be available for connections via MDX API

The following section describes Excel-specific configuration options.

### Dimension hierarchies

MDX API supports dimension hierarchies. You can define multiple hierarchies.
Each level in the hierarchy is a dimension from the view.

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders_view
    description: "Data about orders, amount, count and breakdown by status and geography."
    meta:
      hierarchies:
        - name: "Geography"
          levels:
            - country
            - state
            - city
```

### Measure groups

MDX API supports organizing measures into groups (folders). You can define measure groups in the view's schema file. 

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders_view
    description: "Data about orders, amount, count and breakdown by status and geography."
    meta:
      folders:
          - name: "Folder A"
            members:
              - total_amount
              - average_order_value
          - name: "Folder B"
            members:
              - completed_count
              - completed_percentage
```

## Authentication and authorization

Authentication and authorization work the same as for the [SQL API](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api/security).
