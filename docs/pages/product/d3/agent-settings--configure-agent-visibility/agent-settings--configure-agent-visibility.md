## Overview

Configure agent visibility to control which data views your agents can access. This ensures agents only interact with relevant information, improving efficiency and security.

## Managing Agent Visibility

### Navigating to Agent Settings

To configure agent visibility, first navigate to the agent settings. The specific steps may vary based on your Cube setup. Generally, you will find the agent settings within the main settings menu or through the agent's individual profile.

This screenshot displays the general settings panel for an agent.

It includes options for `Name`, `Description`, `Runtime`, `Plan`, `Model`, `Danger Zone`, and more.

### Restricting Agent Access

Restricting agent access to specific data views enhances security and focus. By limiting the data an agent can see, you prevent accidental data exposure and ensure the agent only works with necessary information.

In the `Semantic Model Section`, select the `Restrict agent to specific views` checkbox.

Then, click the `Search and select a view` dropdown menu.

Choose the desired views to which you want to restrict the agent. You may select multiple views if needed. You can remove views with the `Remove` button.

## Future Capabilities

Cube is developing experimental features for agents. One planned future capability will allow agents to not only consume the data model, but also modify it. This feature is currently labeled as "Experimental" in the settings panel, and includes the `Change Semantic Model` checkbox.
