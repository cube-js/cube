# Getting started with Cube

It's easy to get started with Cube—just click the button below and create your free account. Once your account is created, you can connect your data source or use our demo deployment. AI will build your initial semantic model, and you'll be able to use Cube features such as analytics chat, workbooks, dashboards, and Agentic IDE.

## Getting started with Cube Core

Cube Core is a headless, open-source semantic layer that powers the Cube Business Intelligence Platform. While Cube Core lacks frontend and AI features, you can use it to power your own embedded analytics or build your own AI agent or BI tool.

Cube Core is packaged and distributed as Docker images that can be run in a containerized environment. You can run Cube Core on your own infrastructure with Docker.
