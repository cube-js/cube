# Getting started with Cube

Cube is a cloud-native application, designed to run in a cloud. You can get
started with Cube in one of two ways:
- Run Cube in Cube Cloud and use its managed infrastructure and workspace tools.
- Deploy Cube to your own infrastructure with Docker.

## Getting started with Cube Cloud

**We recommend using [Cube Cloud][cube-cloud], our managed platform for Cube.**
It's the easiest way to build, test, deploy, and manage Cube projects and
it comes with a free tier for development and proof-of-concept projects.

Cube Cloud provides [managed infrastructure][ref-infrastructure] and
[workspace tools][ref-workspace], including features such as collaboration
for teams, a web-based data model editor, synchronization with BI tools,
auto-scaling, and observability.

Please get started with the following guides, tailored for Snowflake and
Databricks users. You may find them insightful even if you
have one of many other supported [data sources][ref-data-sources].

Alternatively, you can explore Cube Cloud on your own or learn by example
in a demo deployment:

  />

    url="deployment/cloud/deployments#demo-deployments"

    title="Create a demo deployment"
  />
</Grid>

## Getting started with Cube Core

Cube Core is packaged and distributed as Docker images that can be run in
a containerized environment. You can run Cube Core on your own
infrastructure with Docker.

## Migrating from Cube Core to Cube Cloud

Cube Cloud supports several ways for importing existing Cube projects:

- [Import a GitHub repository](/product/getting-started/migrate-from-core/import-github-repository)
- [Import a GitLab repository](/product/getting-started/migrate-from-core/import-gitlab-repository-via-ssh)
- [Import a Bitbucket repository](/product/getting-started/migrate-from-core/import-bitbucket-repository-via-ssh)
- [Import a Git repository](/product/getting-started/migrate-from-core/import-git-repository-via-ssh)
- [Import a local project with CLI](/product/getting-started/migrate-from-core/upload-with-cli)
