# Measures

You can use the `measures` parameter within [cubes][ref-ref-cubes] to define measures.
Each measure is an aggregation over a certain column in your database table.

Any measure should have the following parameters: [`name`](#name), [`sql`](#sql), and [`type`](#type).

## Parameters

### `name`

The `name` parameter serves as the identifier of a measure. It must be unique
among all measures, dimensions, and segments within a cube and follow the
[naming conventions][ref-naming].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`
    },

    total_amount: {
      sql: `amount`,
      type: `sum`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: count
        sql: id
        type: count

      - name: total_amount
        sql: amount
        type: sum
```

</CodeTabs>

### `title`

You can use the `title` parameter to change a measureâ€™s displayed name. By
default, Cube will humanize your measure key to create a display name. In order
to override default behavior, please use the `title` parameter.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    orders_count: {
      title: `Number of Orders Placed`,
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: orders_count
        title: Number of Orders Placed
        sql: id
        type: count
```

</CodeTabs>

### `description`

This parameter provides a human-readable description of a measure.
When applicable, it will be displayed in [Playground][ref-playground] and exposed
to data consumers via [APIs and integrations][ref-apis].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    orders_count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
      description: `Count of all orders`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: orders_count
        description: Count of all orders
        sql: id
        type: count
```

</CodeTabs>

### `public`

The `public` parameter is used to manage the visibility of a measure. Valid
values for `public` are `true` and `false`. When set to `false`, this measure
**cannot** be queried through the API. Defaults to `true`.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    orders_count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
      public: false
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: orders_count
        sql: id
        type: count
        public: false
```

</CodeTabs>

### `meta`

Custom metadata. Can be used to pass any information to the frontend.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    revenue: {
      type: `sum`,
      sql: `price`,
      meta: {
        any: "value"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: revenue
        type: sum
        sql: price
        meta:
          any: value
```

</CodeTabs>

### `sql`

`sql` is a required parameter. It can take any valid SQL expression depending on
the `type` of the measure. Please refer to the [Measure Types
Guide][ref-schema-ref-types-formats-measures-types] for detailed information on
the corresponding `sql` parameter.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    users_count: {
      sql: `COUNT(*)`,
      type: `number`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: users_count
        sql: "COUNT(*)"
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

Depending on the measure [type](#type), the `sql` parameter would either:
* Be skipped (in case of the `count` type).
* Contain an aggregate function, e.g., `STRING_AGG(string_dimension, ',')`
(in case of `string`, `time`, `boolean`, and `number` types).
* Contain a non-aggregated expression that Cube would wrap into an aggregate
function according to the measure type (in case of the `avg`, `count_distinct`,
`count_distinct_approx`, `min`, `max`, and `sum` types).

### `filters`

If you want to add some conditions for a metric's calculation, you should use
the `filters` parameter. The syntax looks like the following:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    orders_completed_count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
      filters: [{ sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'` }]
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: orders_completed_count
        sql: id
        type: count
        filters:
          - sql: "{CUBE}.status = 'completed'"
```

</CodeTabs>

### `type`

`type` is a required parameter. There are various types that can be assigned to
a measure. Please refer to the [Measure
Types][ref-schema-ref-types-formats-measures-types] for the full list of measure
types.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    orders_count: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: orders_count
        sql: id
        type: count
```

</CodeTabs>

### `rolling_window`

The `rolling_window` parameter is used to for [rolling window][ref-rolling-window]
calculations, e.g., to calculate a metric over a moving window of time, e.g. a
week or a month.

<WarningBox>

Rolling window calculations require the query to contain a single time dimension
with a provided date range. It is used to calculate the minimum and maximum values
for the series of time windows.

With Tesseract, the [next-generation data modeling engine][link-tesseract],
rolling window calculations don't require the date range for the time dimension.
Tesseract is currently in preview. Use the `CUBEJS_TESSERACT_SQL_PLANNER`
environment variable to enable it.

</WarningBox>

#### `offset`

The `offset` parameter is used to specify the starting point of the time window.

You can set the window `offset` parameter to either `start` or `end`, which will
match the start or end of the window.

By default, the `offset` parameter is set to `end`.

#### `trailing` and `leading`

The `trailing` and `leading` parameters define the size of the time window.
The `trailing` parameter defines the size of the window part before the `offset` point,
and the `leading` parameter defines the size of the window part after the `offset` point.

These parameters have a format defined as `(-?\d+) (minute|hour|day|week|month|year)`.
It means that you can define these parameters using both positive and negative integers.

The `trailing` and `leading` parameters can also be set to `unbounded`,
which means _infinite size_ for the corresponding window part.

By default, the `leading` and `trailing` parameters are set to zero.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    rolling_count_month: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `count`,
      rolling_window: {
        trailing: `1 month`
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: rolling_count_month
        sql: id
        type: count
        rolling_window:
          trailing: 1 month
```

</CodeTabs>

Here's an example of an `unbounded` window that's used for cumulative counts:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    cumulative_count: {
      type: `count`,
      rolling_window: {
        trailing: `unbounded`
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: cumulative_count
        type: count
        rolling_window:
          trailing: unbounded
```

</CodeTabs>

### `multi_stage`

The `multi_stage` parameter is used to define measures that are used with [multi-stage
calculations][ref-multi-stage], e.g., [time-shift measures][ref-time-shift].

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: time_shift
    sql: >
      SELECT '2024-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 100 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 200 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 300 AS revenue UNION ALL

      SELECT '2025-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 400 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 500 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 600 AS revenue

    dimensions:
      - name: time
        sql: time
        type: time

    measures:
      - name: revenue
        sql: revenue
        type: sum

      - name: revenue_prior_year
        multi_stage: true
        sql: "{revenue}"
        type: number
        time_shift:
          - time_dimension: time
            interval: 1 year
            type: prior
```

```javascript
cube(`time_shift`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT '2024-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 100 AS revenue UNION ALL
    SELECT '2024-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 200 AS revenue UNION ALL
    SELECT '2024-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 300 AS revenue UNION ALL

    SELECT '2025-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 400 AS revenue UNION ALL
    SELECT '2025-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 500 AS revenue UNION ALL
    SELECT '2025-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 600 AS revenue
  `,

  dimensions: {
    time: {
      sql: `time`,
      type: `time`
    }
  },

  measures: {
    revenue: {
      sql: `revenue`,
      type: `sum`
    },

    revenue_prior_year: {
      multi_stage: true,
      sql: `${revenue}`,
      type: `number`,
      time_shift: [
        {
          time_dimension: `time`,
          interval: `1 year`,
          type: `prior`
        }
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

### `time_shift`

The `time_shift` parameter is used to configure a [time shift][ref-time-shift] for a
measure. It accepts an array of time shift configurations that consist of `time_dimension`,
`type`, `interval`, and `name` parameters.

#### `type` and `interval`

These parameters define the time shift direction and size. The `type` can be either
`prior` (shifting time backwards) or `next` (shifting time forwards).
The `interval` parameter defines the size of the time shift and has the following format:
`quantity unit`, e.g., `1 year` or `7 days`.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
    measures:
      - name: revenue
        sql: revenue
        type: sum

      - name: revenue_7d_ago
        multi_stage: true
        sql: "{revenue}"
        type: number
        time_shift:
          - interval: 7 days
            type: prior

      - name: revenue_1y_ago
        multi_stage: true
        sql: "{revenue}"
        type: number
        time_shift:
          - interval: 1 year
            type: prior
```

```javascript
  measures: {
    revenue: {
      sql: `revenue`,
      type: `sum`
    },

    revenue_7d_ago: {
      multi_stage: true,
      sql: `${revenue}`,
      type: `number`,
      time_shift: [
        {
          interval: `7 days`,
          type: `prior`
        }
      ]
    },

    revenue_1y_ago: {
      multi_stage: true,
      sql: `${revenue}`,
      type: `number`,
      time_shift: [
        {
          interval: `1 year`,
          type: `prior`
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

</CodeTabs>

#### `time_dimension`

The `time_dimension` parameter is used to specify the time dimension for the time shift.
If it's omitted, Cube will apply the time shift to all time dimensions in the query.
In this case, only single time shift configuration is allowed in `time_shift`.

If `time_dimension` is specified, the time shift will only happen if the query contains
this very time dimension. This is useful if you'd like to apply different time shifts to
different time dimensions or if you want to apply a time shift only when a specific time
dimension is present in the query.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
    measures:
      - name: revenue
        sql: revenue
        type: sum

      - name: lagging_revenue
        multi_stage: true
        sql: "{revenue}"
        type: number
        time_shift:
          - time_dimension: purchase_date
            interval: 3 months
            type: prior

          - time_dimension: shipping_date
            interval: 2 months
            type: prior

          - time_dimension: delivery_date
            interval: 1 month
            type: prior
```

```javascript
  measures: {
    revenue: {
      sql: `revenue`,
      type: `sum`
    },

    lagging_revenue: {
      multi_stage: true,
      sql: `${revenue}`,
      type: `number`,
      time_shift: [
        {
          time_dimension: `purchase_date`,
          interval: `3 months`,
          type: `prior`
        },
        {
          time_dimension: `shipping_date`,
          interval: `2 months`,
          type: `prior`
        },
        {
          time_dimension: `delivery_date`,
          interval: `1 month`,
          type: `prior`
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

</CodeTabs>

#### `name`

The `name` parameter is used to reference a _named time shift_ that is defined on a time
dimension from a [calendar cube][ref-calendar-cubes]. Named time shifts are used in cases
when different measures use the same time shift configuration (e.g., `prior` + `1 year`)
but have to be shifted differently depending on the custom calendar.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: sales_calendar
    calendar: true
    sql: >

Named time shifts also allow to reuse the same time shift configuration across multiple
measures and cubes where they are defined.

### `format`

`format` is an optional parameter. It is used to format the output of measures
in different ways, for example, as currency for `revenue`. Please refer to the
[Measure Formats][ref-schema-ref-types-formats-measures-formats] for the full
list of supported formats.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    total: {
      sql: `amount`,
      type: `sum`,
      format: `currency`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: total
        sql: amount
        type: sum
        format: currency
```

</CodeTabs>

### `drill_members`

Using the `drill_members` parameter, you can define a set of [drill
down][ref-drilldowns] fields for the measure. `drill_members` is defined as an
array of dimensions. Cube automatically injects dimensionsâ€™ names and other
cubesâ€™ names with dimensions in the context, so you can reference these
variables in the `drill_members` array. [Learn more about how to define and use
drill downs][ref-drilldowns].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    revenue: {
      type: `sum`,
      sql: `price`,
      drill_members: [id, price, status, products.name, products.id]
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: revenue
        type: sum
        sql: price
        drill_members:
          - id
          - price
          - status
          - products.name
          - products.id
```
