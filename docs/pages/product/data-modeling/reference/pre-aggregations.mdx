# Pre-aggregations

You can use the `pre_aggregations` parameter within [cubes][ref-ref-cubes] to define
[pre-aggregations][ref-pre-aggs].

Pre-aggregations must have, at minimum, a [name](#name) and a [type](#type).
Pre-aggregations must include all dimensions and measures you will query with.

A pre-aggregation is typically placed in a cube that defines most of dimensions
and measures that this pre-aggregation includes. If a pre-aggregation doesn't
include any dimensions or measures from a cube it's defined in, this
pre-aggregation is ignored.

## Parameters

### `name`

The `name` parameter serves as the identifier of a pre-aggregation. It must be
unique among all pre-aggregations within a cube and follow the [naming
conventions][ref-naming].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_status: {
      dimensions: [
        status
      ],
      measures: [
        count
      ]
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_status
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
    
    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

This `name`, along with the name of the cube, will be used as a prefix for
pre-aggregation tables created in the database.

### `type`

Cube supports the following types of pre-aggregations:

- [`rollup`][self-rollup]
- [`original_sql`][self-originalsql]
- [`rollup_join`][self-rollupjoin]
- [`rollup_lambda`][self-rolluplambda]

The default type is `rollup`.

#### `rollup`

Rollup pre-aggregations are the most effective way to boost performance of any
analytical application. The blazing fast performance of tools like Google
Analytics or Mixpanel are backed by a similar concept. The theory behind it lies
in multi-dimensional analysis, and a rollup pre-aggregation is the result of a
[roll-up operation on an OLAP cube][wiki-olap-ops]. A rollup pre-aggregation is
essentially the summarized data of the original cube grouped by any selected
dimensions of interest.

The most performant kind of rollup pre-aggregation is an **additive** rollup:
all measures of which are based on [decomposable aggregate
functions][wiki-composable-agg-fn]. Additive measure types are: `count`, `sum`,
`min`, `max` or `count_distinct_approx`. The performance boost in this case is
based on two main properties of additive rollup pre-aggregations:

1.  A rollup pre-aggregation table usually contains many fewer rows than its'
    corresponding original fact table. The fewer dimensions that are selected
    for roll-up means fewer rows in the materialized result. A smaller number of
    rows therefore means less time to query rollup pre-aggregation tables.

2.  If your query is a subset of dimensions and measures of an additive rollup,
    then it can be used to calculate a query without accessing the raw data. The
    more dimensions and measures are selected for roll-up, the more queries can
    use this particular rollup.

Rollup definitions can contain members from a single cube as well as from
multiple cubes. In case of multiple cubes being involved, the join query will be
built according to the standard rules of cubes joining.

Rollups are selected for querying based on properties found in queries made to
the Cube REST API. A thorough explanation can be found under [Getting Started
with Pre-Aggregations][ref-caching-preaggs-target].

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_company: {
      measures: [
        count
      ],
      dimensions: [
        status
      ]
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_company
        measures:
          - count
        dimensions:
          - status

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

#### `original_sql`

As the name suggests, it persists the results of the `sql` property of the cube
in the data source (rather than Cube Store). `original_sql` pre-aggregations should
**only** be used when the cube's `sql` is a complex query (i.e., nested subqueries,
window functions, and/or multiple joins).

<WarningBox>

`originalSql` pre-aggregations **must only** be stored in the data source.
While you can set `external: true` for `original_sql` pre-aggregation, this is
not recommended or generally supported.

</WarningBox>

They often do not provide much in the way of performance directly, but there are
two specific applications:

1.  They can be used in tandem with the
    [`use_original_sql_pre_aggregations`][self-origsql-preaggs] option in other
    rollup pre-aggregations.

2.  Situations where it is not possible to use a `rollup` pre-aggregations, such
    as [funnels][ref-recipe-funnels].

For example, to pre-aggregate all completed orders, you could do the following:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`completed_orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE completed = true
  `,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `original_sql`
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: completed_orders
    sql: >
      SELECT *
      FROM orders
      WHERE completed = true

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        type: original_sql

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

#### `rollup_join`

<WarningBox heading={`🐣  Preview`}>

`rollup_join` is currently in Preview, and the API may change in a future
version.

</WarningBox>

<WarningBox>

Rollup join is designed to join data across different data sources.
To join data within the same data source you can list members from different cubes within a regular rollup.
Rollup join can be used only to join two tables, and one can't contain more than
one partition so that the join can operate correctly. It means that at least one
table should be less than 1M of rows. There's work in progress to remove those
limitations.

</WarningBox>

Cube is capable of performing joins between pre-aggregations from different
[data sources][ref-schema-ref-cube-datasource] to avoid making excessive queries
to them.

<WarningBox>

`rollup_join` is an ephemeral pre-aggregation that relies on referenced rollups
when queries are executed. Setting
[`scheduled_refresh`](#parameters-scheduled-refresh) to `true` is unnecessary
for `rollup_join` and will result in an error. Appropriate freshness controls
should be set on referenced rollups instead.

</WarningBox>

In the following example, we have a `users` cube with a `users_rollup`
pre-aggregation, and an `orders` cube with an `orders_rollup` pre-aggregation,
and an `orders_with_users_rollup` pre-aggregation. Note the following:

- Both cubes have different values for `data_source`.
- The type of `orders_with_users_rollup` is `rollup_join`.
- This pre-aggregation has a special property `rollups` which is an array
  containing references to both "source" rollups.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  data_source: `postgres`,
  sql_table: `users`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.id, CUBE.name]
    }
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      // We need to set this field as the primary key for joins to work
      primary_key: true
    },

    name: {
      sql: `first_name || last_name`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
})

cube(`orders`, {
  data_source: `mssql`,
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.user_id, CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`
    },

    // Here we add a new pre-aggregation of type `rollup_join`
    orders_with_users_rollup: {
      type: `rollup_join`,
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [users.name],
      rollups: [users.users_rollup, CUBE.orders_rollup]
    }
  },

  joins: {
    users: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      // Make sure the join uses dimensions on the cube, rather than
      // the column names from the underlying SQL
      sql: `${CUBE.user_id} = ${users.id}`
    }
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true
    },

    user_id: {
      sql: `user_id`,
      type: `number`
    },

    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`
    },

    created_at: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`
    }
  }
})
```

      - name: created_at

```

</CodeTabs>

<InfoBox>

`rollup_join` is not required to join cubes from the same data source; instead,
include the foreign cube's dimensions/measures in the rollup definition
directly:

</InfoBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [users.name, CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_rollup
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - users.name
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
```

</CodeTabs>

#### `rollup_lambda`

<WarningBox>

`rollup_lambda` pre-aggregations **must** be defined **before** any other
pre-aggregations in a cube.

</WarningBox>

A `rollup_lambda` pre-aggregation is a special type of pre-aggregation that can
combine data from data sources and other rollups. It is extremely useful in
scenarios where real-time data is required.

[Lambda pre-aggregations][ref-caching-lambda-preaggs] can be used to combine
data from a data source and a pre-aggregation, or even from multiple
pre-aggregations across different cubes that share the same dimensions and
measures.

### `measures`

The `measures` property is an array of [measures from the
cube][ref-schema-measures] that should be included in the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count]
    }
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup
        measures:
          - CUBE.count

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
```

</CodeTabs>

### `dimensions`

The `dimensions` property is an array of [dimensions from the
cube][ref-schema-dimensions] that should be included in the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      dimensions: [CUBE.status]
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `status`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status

    dimensions:
      - name: status
        type: string
        sql: status
```

</CodeTabs>

### `time_dimension`

The `time_dimension` property can be any [`dimension`][ref-schema-dimensions] of
type [`time`][ref-schema-types-dim-time]. All other measures and dimensions in
the data model are aggregated. This property is an extremely useful tool for
improving performance with massive datasets.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_status: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`
    }
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      type: `string`,
      sql: `status`
    },

    created_at: {
      type: `time`,
      sql: `created_at`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_status
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    dimensions:
      - name: status
        type: string
        sql: status

      - name: created_at
        type: time
        sql: created_at
```

</CodeTabs>

A [`granularity`][self-granularity] **must** also be included in the
pre-aggregation definition.

### `granularity`

The `granularity` property defines the time dimension granularity of data
_within_ the pre-aggregation. If set to `week`, for example, then Cube will
pre-aggregate the data by week and persist it to Cube Store.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup_by_week: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `week`
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup_by_week
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: week
```

</CodeTabs>

The value can be either a default granularity (i.e., `second`, `minute`, `hour`,
`day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, or `year`) or a [custom
granularity][ref-custom-granularity]. This property is required when using
[`time_dimension`][self-timedimension].

### `segments`

The `segments` property is an array of [segments from the
cube][ref-schema-segments] that can target the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      segments: [CUBE.only_complete]
    }
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  segments: {
    only_complete: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        segments:
          - CUBE.only_complete

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    segments:
      - name: only_complete
        sql: "{CUBE}.status = 'completed'"
```

</CodeTabs>

### `partition_granularity`

The `partition_granularity` defines the granularity for each
[partition][ref-caching-partitioning] of the pre-aggregation:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    users_rollup: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: users_rollup
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

The value can be one of `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`. A
[`time_dimension`][self-timedimension] and [`granularity`][self-granularity]
**must** also be included in the pre-aggregation definition. This property is
required when using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning].

Number of partitions to be built per cube is calculated as
[build_range][self-buildrange] divided by `partition_granularity`. Number of
partitions to be built per cube is multiplied by the count of time zones and
tenants in case different tenants have different pre-aggregation SQL.

<WarningBox>

Choose the count of partitions wisely as those consume memory and CPU resources.
As a rule of thumb, you do not want to go over 500-1,000 partitions per pre-aggregation in total
to keep the partitioning overhead low. Too many partitions will most likely
cause out of memory. 
In case of very long build ranges please consider use [Lambda pre-aggregations][ref-caching-lambda-preaggs] to reduce partition count per pre-aggregation.

</WarningBox>

### `refresh_key`

Cube can also take care of keeping pre-aggregations up to date with the
`refresh_key` property. By default, it is set to `every: '1 hour'`, 
if neither of the cubes' pre-aggregation references don't override `refresh_key`.

<InfoBox>

When using [partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-partitioning], the refresh
key is evaluated for each partition separately.

</InfoBox>

#### `sql`

You can set up a custom refresh check strategy by using the `sql` property:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refresh_key: {
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        refresh_key:
          sql: SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

In the above example, the refresh key SQL will be executed every 10 seconds, as
[`every`][self-refreshkey-every] is not defined. If the results of the SQL
refresh key differ from the last execution, then the pre-aggregation will be
refreshed.

#### `every`

The `refresh_key` can define an `every` property which can be used to refresh
pre-aggregations based on a time interval. By default, it is set to `1 hour`
unless the [`sql` property][self-refreshkey-sql] is also defined in any of cubes pre-aggregation references, in which case
it is set to `10 seconds`. For example:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refresh_key: {
        every: `1 day`
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 day

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

To have a pre-aggregation rebuild at a specific time of day, you can use a CRON string with some limitations. For more details about values that can be used with the `every` parameter, please refer to the
[`refreshKey`][ref-cube-refreshkey] documentation.

You can also use `every` with `sql`:

<WarningBox>

Using CRON strings and `sql` is not supported and will result in a compilation error.

</WarningBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      refreshKey: {
        every: `1 hour`,
        sql: `SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders`
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 hour
          sql: SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders
```

</CodeTabs>

In the above example, the refresh key SQL will be executed every hour. If the
results of the SQL refresh key differ from the last execution, then the
pre-aggregation will be refreshed.

#### `incremental`

You can incrementally refresh partitioned rollups by setting
`incremental: true`. This option defaults to `false`.

<WarningBox>

Partition tables are refreshed as a whole. When a new partition table is
available, it replaces the old one. Old partition tables are collected by a
garbage collection mechanism. Append is never used to add new rows to the
existing tables.

</WarningBox>

<WarningBox>

Because incremental refreshes generate their own SQL, you **must not** use the
[`sql`](#parameters-refresh-key-sql) property here.

</WarningBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
      refresh_key: {
        every: `1 day`,
        incremental: true
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: day
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 day
          incremental: true

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

#### `update_window`

<WarningBox>

Incremental refreshes without a defined `update_window` will only update the
last partition as determined by the pre-aggregation's `partition_granularity`.

</WarningBox>

The `incremental: true` flag generates a special `refresh_key` SQL query which
triggers a refresh for partitions where the end date lies within the
`update_window` from the current time.

<WarningBox>

Because incremental refreshes generate their own SQL, you **must not** use the
[`sql`](#parameters-refresh-key-sql) property here.

</WarningBox>

In the example below, it will refresh today's and the last 7 days of partitions
once a day. Partitions before the `7 day` interval **will not** be refreshed
once they are built unless the rollup SQL is changed.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
      refresh_key: {
        every: `1 day`,
        incremental: true,
        update_window: `7 day`
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: day
        refresh_key:
          every: 1 day
          incremental: true
          update_window: 7 day

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

This property is required when using [`incremental`][self-incremental]
refreshes.

### `allow_non_strict_date_range_match`

The `allow_non_strict_date_range_match` parameter is used to allow queries to match a
pre-aggregation even if a query contains a _non-strict date range_. It is set to `true`
by default via the [`CUBEJS_PRE_AGGREGATIONS_ALLOW_NON_STRICT_DATE_RANGE_MATCH`][ref-env-allow-non-strict]
environment variable.

If this flag is set to `false`, Cube would check if requested date range exactly matches
pre-aggregation granularity. For example, if you're requesting half of a day or your date
range filter is just one millisecond off for a pre-aggregation with the daily granularity,
Cube would not use such a pre-aggregation.

With this flag set to `true`, that strict check is lifted. It allows queries from BI tools
to still match pre-aggregations at the cost of a slight potential data discrepancy.
This is convenient when using Cube with visualization tools such as [Tableau][ref-config-downstream-tableau]
or [Apache Superset][ref-config-downstream-superset] that use loose date ranges.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measure: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `day`,
      allow_non_strict_date_range_match: true
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measure:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: day
        allow_non_strict_date_range_match: true
```

</CodeTabs>

### `use_original_sql_pre_aggregations`

Cube supports multi-stage pre-aggregations by reusing original SQL
pre-aggregations in rollups through the `use_original_sql_pre_aggregations`
property. It is helpful in cases where you want to re-use a heavy SQL query
calculation in multiple `rollup` pre-aggregations. Without
`use_original_sql_pre_aggregations` enabled, Cube will always re-execute all
underlying SQL calculations every time it builds new rollup tables.

<WarningBox>

`originalSql` pre-aggregations **must only** be stored in the data source.
While you can set `external: true` for `original_sql` pre-aggregation, this is
not recommended or generally supported.

</WarningBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT * FROM orders1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM orders2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM orders3
  `,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `original_sql`
    },

    statuses: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true
    },

    completed_orders: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.completed_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT * FROM orders1 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM orders2 UNION ALL SELECT *
      FROM orders3

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        type: original_sql

      - name: statuses
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true

      - name: completed_orders
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.completed_at
        granularity: day
        use_original_sql_pre_aggregations: true

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

### `scheduled_refresh`

To always keep pre-aggregations up-to-date, you can set
`scheduled_refresh: true`. This option defaults to `true`. If set to `false`,
pre-aggregations will always be built on-demand. The
[`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] is used to determine if there's a need to
update specific pre-aggregations on each scheduled refresh run. For partitioned
pre-aggregations, `min` and `max` dates for
[`time_dimension`][self-timedimension] are checked to determine range for the
refresh.

Each time a scheduled refresh is run, it takes every pre-aggregation partition
starting with most recent ones in time and checks if the
[`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] has changed. If a change was detected, then
that partition will be refreshed.

In development mode, Cube runs the background refresh by default and will
refresh all pre-aggregations which have `scheduled_refresh: true`.

Please consult [Production Checklist][ref-production-checklist-refresh] for best
practices on running background refresh in production environments.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    orders_by_status: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: orders_by_status
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

### `build_range_start` and `build_range_end`

<WarningBox>

Currently `build_range_start` and `build_range_end` doesn't have any effect on
pre-aggregations without `partition_granularity`. This behavior can be changed
in future versions.

</WarningBox>

<WarningBox>

Cube will **not** return results outside of the defined build range. Data will
**only** be queried within this range, which can lead to an empty result set,
depending on the query. Consider using [Lambda
pre-aggregations][self-rolluplambda] if you want to query data outside of the
build range.

</WarningBox>

The build range defines what partitions should be built by a scheduled refresh.
By default, the build range is defined as the minimum and maximum values
possible for the [`time_dimension`][self-timedimension] used in the rollup.

<WarningBox>

The SQL queries for the build range (as defined by the `sql` property) are
executed based on the [`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] settings of the
pre-aggregation.

In case of very small `update_window` or `FILTER_PARAMS` are used in the [`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] definition 
and the current timestamp is used as `build_range_end`, there's a possibility 
to write [`refresh_key`][self-refreshkey] which won't refresh due to cycle dependency on each other.
To address such cases, you can use relative date in the future for the `build_range_end`.
For example, you can add one day to the current timestamp and use it as `build_range_end`.
The actual value to be added depends on how frequently `refresh_key` is updated.

</WarningBox>

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`,
      build_range_start: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '300 day'`
      },
      build_range_end: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '300 day'
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT NOW()

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

It can be used together with the pre-aggregation's `refresh_key` to define
granular update settings. Set `refresh_key.update_window` to the interval in
which your data can change and `build_range_start` to the earliest point of time
when history should be available.

In the following example, `refresh_key.update_window` is `1 week` and
`build_range_start` is `SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '365 day'`, so the scheduled
refresh will build historical partitions for 365 days in the past and will only
refresh last week's data.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      partition_granularity: `month`,
      build_range_start: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '365 day'`
      },
      build_range_end: {
        sql: `SELECT NOW()`
      },
      refresh_key: {
        update_window: `1 week`
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        partition_granularity: month
        build_range_start:
          sql: SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '365 day'
        build_range_end:
          sql: SELECT NOW()
        refresh_key:
          update_window: 1 week
```

</CodeTabs>

### `union_with_source_data`

This option allows combining a pre-aggregation with fresh data retrieved from
the data source; this is extremely useful in scenarios where latency can be
sacrificed for accuracy.

To configure a pre-aggregation to behave in this way, ensure the pre-aggregation
is of type `rollup_lambda`, and then set `union_with_source_data` to `true`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    lambda: {
      type: `rollup_lambda`,
      union_with_source_data: true,
      rollups: [orders.main]
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: lambda
        type: rollup_lambda
        union_with_source_data: true
        rollups:
          - orders.main
```

</CodeTabs>

### `indexes`

This option allows to define [indexes][ref-indexes]. Indexes are used to
fine-tune pre-aggregation performance when pre-aggregations have significant
cardinality. (For [aggregating indexes][ref-aggregating-indexes], see the
[`type` option](#type-1) below.)

Here's how you can define an index:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    category_and_date: {
      measures: [
        count
      ],
      dimensions: [
        category
      ],
      time_dimension: created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        category_index: {
          columns: [
            category
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: category_and_date
        measures:
          - count
        dimensions:
          - category
        time_dimension: created_at
        granularity: day
        indexes:
          - name: category_index
            columns:
              - category

    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

In the case that you want to reference the time dimension in the index,
the column name as a string in the following format can be used:
`<cube name>__<time dimension name>_<granularity>`:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    category_and_date: {
      measures: [
        CUBE.count
      ],
      dimensions: [
        CUBE.category
      ],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        category_created_at_index: {
          columns: [
            CUBE.category,
            `orders__created_at_day`
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: category_and_date
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.category
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        indexes:
          - name: category_created_at_index
            columns:
              - CUBE.category
              # special syntax needed
              - "{'orders__created_at_day'}"
    # ...
```

</CodeTabs>

The same approach works for `original_sql` pre-aggregations:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      type: `original_sql`,
      indexes: {
        timestamp_index: {
          columns: [
            `timestamp`
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        type: original_sql
        indexes:
          - name: timestamp_index
            columns:
              - timestamp
```

</CodeTabs>

<ReferenceBox>

In some cases, indexes would not work with `original_sql` pre-aggregations.
Please [track this issue](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/issues/7420).

</ReferenceBox>

#### `type`

This option is used to define [aggregating indexes][ref-aggregating-indexes]
that contain **only** dimensions and pre-aggregated measures from the
pre-aggregation definition.

Here's how you can define an aggregating index:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`,

  pre_aggregations: {
    category_and_date: {
      measures: [
        CUBE.count
      ],
      dimensions: [
        CUBE.status
      ],
      time_dimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`,
      indexes: {
        category_index: {
          columns: [
            CUBE.status,
            products.name
          ]
        },
        aggregating_index: {
          columns: [
            CUBE.status
          ],
          type: `aggregate`
        }
      }
    }
  },

  // ...
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: category_and_date
        measures:
          - CUBE.count
        dimensions:
          - CUBE.status
        time_dimension: CUBE.created_at
        granularity: day
        indexes:
          - name: category_index
            columns:
              - CUBE.status
              - Products.name
          - name: aggregating_index
            columns:
              - CUBE.status
            type: aggregate
