# Calculated measures and dimensions

Often, dimensions are mapped to table columns and measures are defined as
aggregations of top of table columns. However, measures and dimensions can also
[reference][ref-references] other members of the same or other cubes, use [SQL
expressions][ref-sql-expressions], and perform calculations involving other measures
and dimensions.

Most common patterns are known as [calculated measures](#calculated-measures),
[proxy dimensions](#proxy-dimensions), and [subquery dimensions](#subquery-dimensions).

## Calculated measures

**Calculated measures perform calculations on other measures using SQL functions and
operators.** They provide a way to decompose complex measures (e.g., ratios or percents)
into formulas that involve simpler measures. Also, calculated measures [can
help][ref-decomposition-recipe] to use [non-additive][ref-non-additive] measures with
pre-aggregations.

In the following example, the `completed_ratio` measure is calculated as a division of
`completed_count` by total `count`. Note that the result is also multiplied by `1.0`
since [integer division in SQL][link-postgres-division] would otherwise produce an
integer value.

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 'processing' AS status UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 'completed'  AS status UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS id, 'completed'  AS status

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

      - name: completed_count
        type: count
        filters:
          - sql: "{CUBE}.status = 'completed'"

      - name: completed_ratio
        sql: "1.0 * {completed_count} / {count}"
        type: number
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT 1 AS id, 'processing' AS status UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 'completed'  AS status UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, 'completed'  AS status
  `,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    },

    completed_count: {
      type: `count`,
      filters: [{
        sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`
      }]
    },

    completed_ratio: {
      sql: `1.0 * ${completed_count} / ${count}`,
      type: `number`
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

If you query for `completed_ratio`, Cube will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  1.0 * COUNT(
    CASE WHEN ("orders".status = 'completed') THEN 1 END
  ) / COUNT(*) "orders__completed_ratio"
FROM (
  SELECT 1 AS id, 'processing' AS status UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, 'completed'  AS status UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 AS id, 'completed'  AS status
) AS "orders"
```

## Proxy dimensions

**Proxy dimensions reference dimensions from the same cube or other cubes.**
Proxy dimensions are convenient for reusing existing dimensions when defining
new ones.

### Members of the same cube

If you have a dimension with a non-trivial definition, you can reference that
dimension to reuse the existing definition and reduce code duplication.

In the following example, the `full_name` dimension references `initials` and
`last_name` dimensions of the same cube:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql_table: users

    dimensions:
      - name: initials
        sql: "SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1)"
        type: string

      - name: last_name
        sql: "UPPER(last_name)"
        type: string

      - name: full_name
        sql: "{initials} || '. ' || {last_name}"
        type: string
```

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  sql_table: `users`,

  dimensions: {
    initials: {
      sql: `SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1)`,
      type: `string`
    },

    last_name: {
      sql: `UPPER(last_name)`,
      type: `string`
    },

    full_name: {
      sql: `${initials} || '. ' || ${last_name}`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

If you query for `users.full_name`, Cube will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1) || '. ' || UPPER(last_name) "users__full_name"
FROM
  users AS "users"
GROUP BY
  1
```

### Members of other cubes

If you have `first_cube` that is [joined][ref-joins] to `second_cube`, you can use a
proxy dimension to bring `second_cube.dimension` to `first_cube` as `dimension` (or
under a different name). When you query for a proxy dimension, Cube will transparently
generate SQL with necessary joins.

In the following example, `orders.user_name` is a proxy dimension that brings the
`users.name` dimension to `orders`. You can also see that there's a join relationship
between `orders` and `users`:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS id, 2 AS user_id

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: user_name
        sql: "{users.name}"
        type: string

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    joins:
      - name: users
        sql: "{users}.id = {orders}.user_id"
        relationship: one_to_many

  - name: users
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob'   AS name

    dimensions:
      - name: name
        sql: name
        type: string
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT 1 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, 2 AS user_id
  `,

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true
    },

    user_name: {
      sql: `${users.name}`,
      type: `string`
    }
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  joins: {
    users: {
      sql: `${users}.id = ${orders}.user_id`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`
    }
  }
})

cube(`users`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob'   AS name
  `,

  dimensions: {
    name: {
      sql: `name`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

If you query for `orders.user_name` and `orders.count`, Cube will generate the
following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "users".name "orders__user_name",
  COUNT(DISTINCT "orders".id) "orders__count"
FROM (
  SELECT 1 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 AS id, 2 AS user_id
) AS "orders"
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob'   AS name
) AS "users" ON "users".id = "orders".user_id
GROUP BY 1
```

Note that if you query for `orders.user_name` only, Cube will figure out that it's
equivalent to querying just `users.name` and there's no need to generate a join in SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "users".name "orders__user_name"
FROM (
  SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob'   AS name
) AS "users"
GROUP BY 1
```

### Time dimension granularity

When referencing a [time dimension][ref-time-dimension] of the same or another
cube, you can specificy a granularity to refer to a time value with that specific
granularity. It can be one of the [default granularities][ref-default-granularities]
(e.g., `year` or `week`) or a [custom granularity][ref-custom-granularities]:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql: >
      SELECT '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-02-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-03-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at

    dimensions:
      - name: created_at
        sql: created_at
        type: time

        granularities:
          - name: sunday_week
            interval: 1 week
            offset: -1 day

      - name: created_at__year
        sql: "{created_at.year}"
        type: time

      - name: created_at__sunday_week
        sql: "{created_at.sunday_week}"
        type: time
```

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at UNION ALL
    SELECT '2025-02-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at UNION ALL
    SELECT '2025-03-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at
  `,

  dimensions: {
    created_at: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,

      granularities: {
        sunday_week: {
          interval: `1 week`,
          offset: `-1 day`
        }
      }
    },

    created_at__year: {
      sql: `${created_at.year}`,
      type: `time`
    },

    created_at__sunday_week: {
      sql: `${created_at.sunday_week}`,
      type: `time`
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

If you query for `users.created_at`, `users.created_at__sunday_week`, and
`users.created_at__year` dimensions, Cube will generate the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "users".created_at "users__created_at",
  date_trunc('week', ("users".created_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') - interval '-1 day') + interval '-1 day' "users__created_at__sunday_week",
  date_trunc('year', ("users".created_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) "users__created_at__year"
FROM (
  SELECT '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at UNION ALL
  SELECT '2025-02-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at UNION ALL
  SELECT '2025-03-01T00:00:00Z' AS created_at
) AS "users"
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
```

## Subquery dimensions

**Subquery dimensions reference measures from other cubes.** Subquery dimensions
provide a way to define measures that aggregate values of other measures. They can be
useful to calculate nested and filtered aggregates.

<ReferenceBox>

See the following recipes:

- To learn how to calculate [nested aggregates][ref-nested-aggregates-recipe].
- To learn how to calculate [filtered aggregates][ref-filtered-aggregates-recipe].

</ReferenceBox>

If you have `first_cube` that is [joined][ref-joins] to `second_cube`, you can use a
subquery dimension to bring `second_cube.measure` to `first_cube` as `dimension` (or
under a different name). When you query for a subquery dimension, Cube will
transparently generate SQL with necessary joins. It works as a [correlated
subquery][wiki-correlated-subquery] but is implemented via joins for optimal
performance and portability.

In the following example, `users.order_count` is a subquery dimension that brings the
`orders.count` measure to `users`. Note that the [`sub_query` parameter][ref-ref-subquery]
is set to `true` on `users.order_count`. You can also see that there's a join
relationship between `orders` and `users`:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS id, 2 AS user_id

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

    joins:
      - name: users
        sql: "{users}.id = {orders}.user_id"
        relationship: one_to_many

  - name: users
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob'   AS name

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        primary_key: true

      - name: name
        sql: name
        type: string

      - name: order_count
        sql: "{orders.count}"
        type: number
        sub_query: true

    measures:
      - name: avg_order_count
        sql: "{order_count}"
        type: avg
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT 1 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, 2 AS user_id
  `,

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true
    }
  },

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  },

  joins: {
    users: {
      sql: `${users}.id = ${orders}.user_id`,
      relationship: `one_to_many`
    }
  }
})

cube(`users`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob'   AS name
  `,

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      primary_key: true
    },

    name: {
      sql: `name`,
      type: `string`
    },

    order_count: {
      sql: `${orders.count}`,
      type: `number`,
      sub_query: true
    }
  },

  measures: {
    avg_order_count: {
      sql: `${order_count}`,
      type: `avg`
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

You can reference subquery dimensions in measures just like usual dimensions. In the
example above, the `avg_order_count` measure performs an aggregation on `order_count`.

If you query for `users.name` and `users.order_count`, Cube will generate the
following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  "users".name "users__name",
  "users__order_count" "users__order_count"
FROM (
  SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob' AS name
) AS "users"
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT
    "users_order_count_subquery__users".id "users__id",
    count(distinct "users_order_count_subquery__orders".id) "users__order_count"
  FROM (
    SELECT 1 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 1 AS user_id UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, 2 AS user_id
  ) AS "users_order_count_subquery__orders"
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 1 AS id, 'Alice' AS name UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob' AS name
  ) AS "users_order_count_subquery__users" ON "users_order_count_subquery__users".id = "users_order_count_subquery__orders".user_id
  GROUP BY 1
) AS "users_order_count_subquery" ON "users_order_count_subquery"."users__id" = "users".id
GROUP BY 1, 2
```
