# Subquery dimensions

You can use subquery dimensions to reference [measures][ref-schema-ref-measures]
from other cubes inside a [dimension][ref-schema-ref-dimensions]. Under the
hood, it behaves [as a correlated subquery][wiki-correlated-subquery], but is
implemented via joins for optimal performance and portability.

<WarningBox>

You cannot use subquery dimensions to reference measures from the same cube.

Consider the following tables, where we have `deals` and `sales_managers`.
`deals` belong to `sales_managers` and have the `amount` dimension. What we want
is to calculate the amount of deals for `sales_managers`:

/>

To calculate the deals amount for sales managers in pure SQL, we can use a
correlated subquery, which will look like this:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  (
    SELECT SUM(amount)
    FROM deals
    WHERE deals.sales_manager_id = sales_managers.id
  ) AS deals_amount
FROM sales_managers
GROUP BY 1
```

Cube makes subqueries easy and efficient. Subqueries are defined as regular
dimensions with the parameter `sub_query` set to true.

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`deals`, {
  sql_table: `deals`,

  measures: {
    amount: {
      sql: `amount`,
      type: `sum`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    sales_manager_id: {
      sql: `sales_manager_id`,
      type: `string`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`sales_managers`, {
  sql_table: `sales_managers`,

  joins: {
    deals: {
      relationship: `one_to_many`,
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${deals.sales_manager_id}`,
    },
  },

  measures: {
    average_deal_amount: {
      sql: `${deals_amount}`,
      type: `avg`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    deals_amount: {
      sql: `${deals.amount}`,
      type: `number`,
      sub_query: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: deals
    sql_table: deals

    measures:
      - name: amount
        sql: amount
        type: sum

    dimensions:
      - name: sales_manager_id
        sql: sales_manager_id
        type: string

  - name: sales_managers
    sql_table: sales_managers

    joins:
      - name: deals
        relationship: one_to_many
        sql: "{sales_managers}.id = {deals.sales_manager_id}"

    measures:
      - name: average_deal_amount
        sql: "{deals_amount}"
        type: avg

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

      - name: deals_amount
        sql: "{deals.amount}"
        type: number
        sub_query: true
```

A subquery requires referencing at least one [measure][ref-schema-ref-measures]
in its definition. Generally speaking, all the columns used to define a subquery
dimension should first be defined as [measures][ref-schema-ref-measures] on
their respective cubes and then referenced from a subquery dimension over a
[join][ref-schema-ref-joins]. For example the following data model will **not**
work:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`deals`, {
  sql_table: `deals`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },
});

cube(`sales_managers`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    // ...

    deals_amount: {
      sql: `SUM(${deals.amount})`, // Doesn't work, because `amount` is not a measure on `deals`
      type: `number`,
      sub_query: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: deals
    sql_table: deals

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

  - name: sales_managers
    # ...

    dimensions:
      # ...

      - name: deals_amount
        sql: "SUM({deals}.amount)" # Doesn't work, because `amount` is not a measure on `deals`
        type: number
        sub_query: true
```

</CodeTabs>

You can reference subquery dimensions in measures as usual
[dimensions][ref-schema-ref-dimensions]. The example below shows the definition
of an average deal amount per sales manager:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`sales_managers`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    average_deals_amount: {
      sql: `${deals_amount}`,
      type: `avg`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `string`,
      primary_key: true,
    },

    deals_amount: {
      sql: `${deals.amount}`,
      type: `number`,
      sub_query: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: sales_managers

    measures:
      - name: average_deals_amount
        sql: "{deals_amount}"
        type: avg

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: string
        primary_key: true

      - name: deals_amount
        sql: "{deals.amount}"
        type: number
        sub_query: true
```

</CodeTabs>

## Under the hood

Based on the subquery dimension definition, Cube will create a query that will
include the primary key dimension of the main cube and all
[measures][ref-schema-ref-measures] and [dimensions][ref-schema-ref-dimensions]
included in the SQL definition of the subquery dimension.

This query will be joined as a `LEFT JOIN` onto the main SQL query. For example,
when using the `sales_managers.deals_amount` subquery dimension, the following
query will be generated:

```json
{
  "measures": ["sales_managers.deals_amount"],
  "dimensions": ["sales_managers.id"]
}
```

If a query includes the `sales_managers.average_deal_amount` measure, the
following SQL will be generated:

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(sales_managers__average_deal_amount)
FROM sales_managers
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT
    sales_managers.id sales_managers__id,
    SUM(deals.amount) sales_managers__average_deal_amount
  FROM sales_managers
  LEFT JOIN deals
    ON sales_managers.id = deals.sales_manager_id
  GROUP BY 1
) sales_managers__average_deal_amount_subquery
  ON sales_managers__average_deal_amount_subquery.sales_managers__id = sales_managers.id
```
