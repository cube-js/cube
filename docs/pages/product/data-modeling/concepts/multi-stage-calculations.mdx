# Multi-stage calculations

[Measures][ref-measures] are usually calculated as aggregations over [dimensions][ref-dimensions]
or arbitrary SQL expressions.

_Multi-stage calculations_ enable data modeling of more sophisticated _multi-stage measures_.
They are calculated in two or more stages and often involve manipulations on already
aggregated data. Each stage results in one or more [common table expressions][link-cte]
(CTEs) in the generated SQL query.

<WarningBox>

Multi-stage calculations are powered by Tesseract, the [next-generation data modeling
engine][link-tesseract]. Tesseract is currently in preview. Use the
`CUBEJS_TESSERACT_SQL_PLANNER` environment variable to enable it.

</WarningBox>

<WarningBox>

Multi-stage calculations are not currently accelerated by pre-aggregations.
Please track [this issue](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/issues/8487).

</WarningBox>

Common uses of multi-stage calculations:

- [Rolling window](#rolling-window) calculations.
- [Period-to-date](#period-to-date) calculations, e.g., year-to-date (YTD) analysis.
- [Prior date](#prior-date) calculations, e.g., year-over-year sales growth.
- [Fixed dimension](#fixed-dimension) calculations, e.g., comparing individual items to a broader dataset or calculating percent of total.
- [Ranking](#ranking) calculations.

## Rolling window

Rolling window calculations are used to calculate metrics over a moving window of time.
Use the [`rolling_window` parameter][ref-rolling-window] of a measure to define
a rolling window.

### Stages

Here's how the rolling window calculation is performed:

- **Date range.** First, the date range for the query is determined.
If there's a time dimension with a date range filter in the query, it's used.
Otherwise, the date range is determined by selecting the minimum and maximum
values for the time dimension.

<WarningBox>

Tesseract enables rolling window calculations without the date range for the time dimension.
If Tesseract is not used, the date range must be provided. Otherwise, the query would
fail with the following error: `Time series queries without dateRange aren't supported`.

</WarningBox>

- **Time windows.** Then, the series of time windows is calculated. The size of the
window is defined by the time dimension granularity and the `trailing` and
`leading` parameters.
- **Measure.** Finally, the measure is calculated for each window.

### Example

Data model:

```yaml

cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, '2025-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, '2025-01-11'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS id, '2025-01-21'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 4 AS id, '2025-01-31'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 5 AS id, '2025-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 6 AS id, '2025-02-11'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 7 AS id, '2025-02-21'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 8 AS id, '2025-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 9 AS id, '2025-03-11'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 10 AS id, '2025-03-21'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 11 AS id, '2025-03-31'::TIMESTAMP AS time UNION ALL
      SELECT 12 AS id, '2025-04-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time

    dimensions:
      - name: time
        sql: time
        type: time
 
    measures:
      - name: rolling_count_month
        sql: id
        type: count
        rolling_window:
          trailing: unbounded
```

## Period-to-date

Period-to-date calculations can be used to analyze data over different time periods:

- Year-to-date (YTD) analysis.
- Quarter-to-date (QTD) analysis.
- Month-to-date (MTD) analysis.

```yaml
- name: revenue_ytd
  sql: revenue
  type: sum
  rolling_window:
    type: to_date
    granularity: year
  
- name: revenue_qtd
  sql: revenue
  type: sum
  rolling_window:
    type: to_date
    granularity: quarter
  
- name: revenue_mtd
  sql: revenue
  type: sum
  rolling_window:
    type: to_date
    granularity: month
```

### Example

Data model:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: period_to_date
    sql: >
      SELECT '2024-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-04-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-05-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-06-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-07-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-08-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-09-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-10-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-11-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-12-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-04-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-05-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2025-06-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue

    dimensions:
      - name: time
        sql: time
        type: time

    measures:
      - name: revenue_ytd
        sql: revenue
        type: sum
        rolling_window:
          type: to_date
          granularity: year
        
      - name: revenue_qtd
        sql: revenue
        type: sum
        rolling_window:
          type: to_date
          granularity: quarter
        
      - name: revenue_mtd
        sql: revenue
        type: sum
        rolling_window:

## Prior date

Prior date calculations can be used to find the difference between two aggregated
measures, like year-over-year sales growth.

```yaml
- name: revenue_prior_year
  multi_stage: true
  sql: "{revenue}"
  type: number
  time_shift:
    - time_dimension: calendar.CalendarDate
      interval: 1 year
      type: prior
      
- name: revenue_prior_year_ytd
  multi_stage: true
  sql: "{revenue_ytd}"
  type: number
  time_shift:
    - time_dimension: calendar.CalendarDate
      interval: 1 year
      type: prior
```

### Example

Data model:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: prior_date
    sql: >
      SELECT '2023-04-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-05-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-06-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-07-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-08-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-09-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-10-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-11-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2023-12-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-01-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-02-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-03-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-04-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-05-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-06-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-07-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL
      SELECT '2024-08-01'::TIMESTAMP AS time, 1000 AS revenue UNION ALL

## Fixed dimension

Fixed dimension calculations can be used to perform fixed comparisons, e.g., to compare
individual items to a broader dataset.

For example, comparing revenue sales to the overall average:

```yaml
- name: revenue
  sql: revenue
  format: currency
  type: sum
  
- name: occupied_sq_feet
  sql: occupied_sq_feet
  type: sum

- name: occupied_sq_feet_per_city
  multi_stage: true
  sql: "{occupied_sq_feet}"
  type: sum
  group_by:
    - city
    - state

- name: revenue_per_city_sq_feet
  multi_stage: true
  sql: "{revenue} / NULLIF({occupied_sq_feet_per_city}, 0)"
  type: number
```

Percent of total calculations:

```yaml
- name: revenue
  sql: revenue
  format: currency
  type: sum

- name: country_revenue
  multi_stage: true
  sql: "{revenue}"
  type: sum
  group_by:
    - country

- name: country_revenue_percentage
  multi_stage: true
  sql: "{revenue} / NULLIF({country_revenue}, 0)"
  type: number
```

### Example

Data model:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: percent_of_total
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 1000 AS revenue, 'A' AS product, 'USA' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 2000 AS revenue, 'B' AS product, 'USA' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS id, 3000 AS revenue, 'A' AS product, 'Austria' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 4 AS id, 4000 AS revenue, 'B' AS product, 'Austria' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 5 AS id, 5000 AS revenue, 'A' AS product, 'Netherlands' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 6 AS id, 6000 AS revenue, 'B' AS product, 'Netherlands' AS country

    dimensions:
      - name: product
        sql: product
        type: string

      - name: country
        sql: country
        type: string

    measures:
      - name: revenue
        sql: revenue
        format: currency
        type: sum
      
      - name: country_revenue
        multi_stage: true
        sql: "{revenue}"
        format: currency
        type: sum
        group_by:
          - country
      
      - name: country_revenue_percentage
        multi_stage: true
        sql: "{revenue} / NULLIF({country_revenue}, 0)"
        type: number
```

## Ranking

Ranking calculations can be used to get valuable insights, especially when analyzing
data across various dimensions.

```yaml
- name: product_rank
  multi_stage: true
  order_by:
    - sql: "{revenue}"
      dir: asc
  reduce_by: 
    - product
  type: rank
```

You can reduce by one or more dimensions.

### Example

Data model:

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: ranking
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 1000 AS revenue, 'A' AS product, 'USA' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 2000 AS revenue, 'B' AS product, 'USA' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS id, 3000 AS revenue, 'A' AS product, 'Austria' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 4 AS id, 4000 AS revenue, 'B' AS product, 'Austria' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 5 AS id, 5000 AS revenue, 'A' AS product, 'Netherlands' AS country UNION ALL
      SELECT 6 AS id, 6000 AS revenue, 'B' AS product, 'Netherlands' AS country

    dimensions:
      - name: product
        sql: product
        type: string

      - name: country
        sql: country
        type: string

    measures:
      - name: revenue
        sql: revenue
        format: currency
        type: sum

      - name: product_rank
        multi_stage: true
        order_by:
          - sql: "{revenue}"
            dir: asc
        reduce_by: 
          - product
        type: rank
```
