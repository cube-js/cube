# Querying the data model

Ultimately, after creating a data model, you would like to *ask questions
to it*, i.e., run queries against this data model. This page describes the
concepts of querying Cube, common to [all or most APIs][ref-apis]
that you will use to run these queries.

## Query defaults

The following defaults apply to all queries run by Cube.

### Row limit

By default, [any query](#query-types) will return no more than 10,000 rows
in the result set. It serves as a safeguard against data scraping and
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if Cube is exposed to untrusted environments.

The maximum allowed limit is 50,000 rows. You can use the `CUBEJS_DB_QUERY_LIMIT`
environment variable to override it. You can also implement
[pagination][ref-pagination-recipe] to fetch more rows than the maximum limit.

### Time zone

All time-based calculations performed by Cube are time zone-aware.

By default, Cube assumes that time values in your queries (e.g., in date range
filters) are in the [UTC time zone][wiki-utc-time-zone]. Similarly, it will use
the same time zone for time dimension values in result sets.

You can use the `timezone` option with [REST API][ref-rest-api-query-format-options]
or [GraphQL API][ref-ref-graphql-api-args] to specify the time zone for a query.
Also, you can use the [`SQL_UTILS` context variable][ref-sql-utils] to apply the
time zone conversion to dimensions that are not used as time dimensions in a query.

Additionally, note that time zones have impact on [pre-aggregation
matching][ref-matching-preaggs-time-dimensions].

## Query types

Most commonly, you will run [regular queries](#regular-query). See the table
and the sections below for details on each query type.

| Query type | Supported by [APIs][ref-apis] | Supported in [Playground][ref-playground] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Regular query](#regular-query) | [SQL API][ref-sql-api], [REST API][ref-rest-api], [GraphQL API][ref-graphql-api] | ✅ Yes |
| [Ungrouped query](#ungrouped-query) | [SQL API][ref-sql-api], [REST API][ref-rest-api], [GraphQL API][ref-graphql-api] | ❌ No |
| [Compare date range query](#compare-date-range-query) | [SQL API][ref-sql-api], [REST API][ref-rest-api] | ❌ No |
| [Total query](#total-query) | [REST API][ref-rest-api] | ❌ No |

### Regular query

This is the most common type of queries. Regular queries include:
- Lists of dimensions and measures that you'd like to see in the result set.
- Optionally, filters to apply before returning the result set.
- Optionally, a [row limit](#row-limit) and an offset for the result set.

For regular queries, Cube generates the SQL for the upstream [data
sources][ref-data-sources] that always includes all dimensions in the `GROUP BY`
statement. See [ungrouped queries](#ungrouped-query) if you'd like to override
this behavior.

#### Example

See an example of a regular query using the SQL API syntax:

```sql
SELECT
  city,
  MEASURE(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'shipped'
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 100
```

The same query using the REST API syntax looks as follows:

```json
{
  "dimensions": ["orders.city"],
  "measures": ["orders.amount"],
  "filters": [
    {
      "member": "orders.status",
      "operator": "equals",
      "values": ["shipped"]
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100
}
```

### Ungrouped query

Similarly to [regular queries](#regular-queries), ungrouped queries include
lists of dimensions and measures, filters, etc. and return a result set.

However, unlike for regular queries, Cube will not add the
`GROUP BY` statement when generating the SQL for the upstream data sources.
Instead, raw results after filtering and joining will be returned without any
grouping. Measures will be rendered as their `sql` without any aggregation.
Time dimensions will be truncated by granularity as usual, however, not grouped by.

You can make a regular query ungrouped by using the `ungrouped` option with
[REST API][ref-rest-api-query-format-options] or [GraphQL API][ref-ref-graphql-api-args].
For the [SQL API][ref-sql-api], you can omit the `GROUP BY` statement from the
SQL API query.

By default, for security purposes, ungrouped queries require [primary
keys][ref-primary-key] of all cubes involved in a query to be added as
dimensions. You can use the [`allow_ungrouped_without_primary_key` configration
option][ref-conf-allow-ungrouped] to override this.

Additionally, note that ungrouped queries have additional requirements for
[pre-aggregation matching][ref-matching-preaggs-ungrouped].

### Compare date range query

Similarly to [regular queries](#regular-queries), compare date range queries
include lists of dimensions and measures, filters, etc. and return a result set.

However, unlike regular queries, they provide a convenient way to retrieve
measure values for *more than one date range* for a time dimension. See [this
blog post][blog-compare-date-range] for more details and examples.

You can make a compare date range query by using the `compareDateRange`
option with the [REST API][ref-rest-api-query-format-options-tdf]. For the SQL
API, you can write an equivalent query using the `UNION ALL` statement.

### Total query

Similarly to [regular queries](#regular-queries), total queries include lists
of dimensions and measures, filters, etc. and return a result set.

In addition to that, they provide a convenient way to retrieve the total number
of rows in the result set as if no [row limit](#row-limit) or offset are set in
the query. This is useful for creating user interfaces with
[pagination][ref-pagination-recipe].

You can make a total query by using the `total` option with the [REST
API][ref-rest-api-query-format-options]. For the SQL API, you can write an
equivalent query using the `UNION ALL` statement.
