# Concepts

Cube borrows a lot of terminology from [OLAP
theory][wiki-olap], and this document is intended for both newcomers and regular
users to refresh their understanding.

We'll use a sample e-commerce database with two tables, `orders` and
`line_items` to illustrate the concepts throughout this page:

**`orders`**

| **id** | **status** | **completed_at**           | **created_at**             |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1      | completed  | 2019-01-05 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 2      | shipped    | 2019-01-17 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 3      | completed  | 2019-01-27 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 4      | shipped    | 2019-01-09 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |
| 5      | processing | 2019-01-29 00:00:00.000000 | 2019-01-02 00:00:00.000000 |

**`line_items`**

| **id** | **product_id** | **order_id** | **quantity** | **price** | **created_at**             |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | -------------------------- |
| 1      | 31             | 1            | 1            | 275       | 2019-01-31 00:00:00.000000 |
| 2      | 49             | 2            | 6            | 248       | 2021-01-20 00:00:00.000000 |
| 3      | 89             | 3            | 6            | 197       | 2021-11-25 00:00:00.000000 |
| 4      | 71             | 4            | 8            | 223       | 2019-12-23 00:00:00.000000 |
| 5      | 64             | 5            | 5            | 75        | 2019-04-20 00:00:00.000000 |

We'll be following the [entity-first](#entity-first-approach) approach to
designing the data model.

<ReferenceBox>

See [this recipe][ref-entities-vs-metrics-recipe] to learn about entity-first and
metrics-first approaches.

</ReferenceBox>

## Cubes

_Cubes_ represent datasets in Cube and are conceptually similar to [views in
SQL][wiki-view-sql]. Cubes are usually declared in separate files with one
cube per file. Typically, a cube points to a single table in
your database using the [`sql_table` property][ref-schema-ref-sql-table]:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql_table: `orders`
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql_table: orders
```

</CodeTabs>

<ReferenceBox>

If you're using dbt, see [this recipe][ref-cube-with-dbt] to streamline defining cubes
on top of dbt models.

</ReferenceBox>

You can also use the [`sql` property][ref-schema-ref-sql] to accommodate more
complex SQL queries:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT *
    FROM orders, line_items
    WHERE orders.id = line_items.order_id
  `
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    sql: >
      SELECT *
      FROM orders, line_items
      WHERE orders.id = line_items.order_id

```

</CodeTabs>

Each cube contains the definitions of its _members_: [dimensions](#dimensions),
[measures](#measures), and [segments](#segments). You can control the access to
cubes and their members by configuring the [member-level security][ref-mls].

[Joins](#joins) are used to define relations between cubes.
[Pre-aggregations](#pre-aggregations) are used to accelerate queries to cubes.
Cubes and their members can be further referenced by [views](#views).

Note that cubes support [extension][ref-extending-cubes],
[polymorphism][ref-polymorphic-cubes], and [data blending][ref-data-blending].
Cubes can be defined statically and you can also build [dynamic data
models][ref-dynamic-data-models].

<InfoBox>

Cube supports data models that consist of thousands of cubes and views.
For large [multi-tenancy][ref-multitenancy] configurations, e.g., with more than
100 tenants, consider using a [multi-cluster deployment][ref-pmc].

</InfoBox>

<ReferenceBox>

See the reference documentaton for the full list of cube [parameters][ref-cubes].

</ReferenceBox>

## Views

_Views_ sit on top of the data graph of cubes and create a facade of your whole
data model with which data consumers can interact. They are useful for defining
metrics, managing governance and data access, and controlling ambiguous join
paths.

<Diagram src="https://ucarecdn.com/bfc3e04a-b690-40bc-a6f8-14a9175fb4fd/" />

Views do **not** define their own members. Instead, they reference cubes by
specific join paths and include their members.

In the example below, we create the `orders` view which includes select members
from `base_orders`, `products`, and `users` cubes:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
view(`orders`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: base_orders,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `created_date`,
        `total_amount`,
        `total_amount_shipped`,
        `count`,
        `average_order_value`
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.line_items.products,
      includes: [
        {
          name: `name`,
          alias: `product`
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      join_path: base_orders.users,
      prefix: true,
      includes: `*`,
      excludes: [`company`]
    }
  ]
})
```

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders

    cubes:
      - join_path: base_orders
        includes:
          - status
          - created_date
          - total_amount
          - total_amount_shipped
          - count
          - average_order_value

      - join_path: base_orders.line_items.products
        includes:
          - name: name
            alias: product

      - join_path: base_orders.users
        prefix: true
        includes: "*"
        excludes:
          - company
```

</CodeTabs>

Views do **not** define any [pre-aggregations](#pre-aggregations). Instead,
they [reuse][ref-matching-preaggs] pre-aggregations from underlying cubes.

View can be defined statically and you can also build [dynamic data
models][ref-dynamic-data-models].

<ReferenceBox>

See the reference documentaton for the full list of view [parameters][ref-views].

</ReferenceBox>

### Folders

Optionally, members of a view can be organized into [folders][ref-ref-folders].
Each folder would contain a subset of members of the view.

Cube supports both flat and nested folder structures, which can be used with various
[visualization tools][ref-viz-tools]. If a specific tool does not support nested folders,
they will be exposed to such a tool as an equivalent flat structure. Check [APIs &
Integrations][ref-apis-support] for details on the nested folders support.

## Dimensions

_Dimensions_ represent the properties of a **single** data point in the cube.
[The `orders` table](#top) contains only dimensions, so representing them in the
`orders` cube is straightforward:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      // Here we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
      // This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
      primary_key: true
    },

    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        # Here we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
        # This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
        primary_key: true

      - name: status
        sql: status
        type: string
```

</CodeTabs>

Note that the `id` dimension is defined as a [primary key][ref-ref-primary-key].
It is also possible to have more than one primary key dimension in a cube if
you'd like them all to be parts of a composite key.

[The `line_items` table](#top) also has a couple of dimensions which can be
represented as follows:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`line_items`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    id: {
      sql: `id`,
      type: `number`,
      // Again, we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
      // This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
      primary_key: true
    },

    order_id: {
      sql: `order_id`,
      type: `number`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: line_items
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: id
        sql: id
        type: number
        # Again, we explicitly let Cube know this field is the primary key
        # This is required for de-duplicating results when using joins
        primary_key: true

      - name: order_id
        sql: order_id
        type: number
```

</CodeTabs>

If needed, dimensions can be organized into [hierarchies][ref-ref-hierarchies].
Also, [proxy dimensions][ref-proxy-dimensions] are helpful for code reusability
and [subquery dimensions][ref-subquery-dimensions] can be used to join cubes
implicitly.

<ReferenceBox>

See the reference documentaton for the full list of [dimension parameters][ref-dimensions].

</ReferenceBox>

### Dimension types

Dimensions can be of different types, e.g., `string`, `number`, or `time`. Often,
data types in SQL are mapped to dimension types in the following way:

| Data type in SQL | Dimension type in Cube |
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp`, `date`, `time` | [`time`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#time) |
| `text`, `varchar` | [`string`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#string) |
| `integer`, `bigint`, `decimal` | [`number`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#number) |
| `boolean` | [`boolean`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#boolean) |

<ReferenceBox>

See the [dimension type reference][ref-ref-dimension-types] for details.

</ReferenceBox>

### Time dimensions

Time-based properties are modeled using dimensions of the [`time`
type][ref-ref-time-dimensions]. They allow grouping the result set by a unit of
time (e.g., days, weeks, month, etc.), also known as the *time dimension
granularity*.

The following granularities are available by default for any time dimension:
`year`, `quarter`, `month`, `week` (starting on Monday), `day`, `hour`, `minute`,
`second`. You can also define [custom granularities][ref-ref-dimension-granularities]
and optionally expose them via [proxy dimensions][ref-proxy-granularity] in case
you need to use weeks starting on Sunday, fiscal years, etc.

<ReferenceBox>

See the following recipes:
- For a [custom granularity][ref-custom-granularity-recipe] example.
- For a [custom calendar][ref-custom-calendar-recipe] example.

</ReferenceBox>

Here's how we can add time dimensions to the data model:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  dimensions: {
    created_at: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`
      // You can use this time dimension with all default granularities:
      // year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, minute, second
    },

    completed_at: {
      sql: `completed_at`,
      type: `time`,
      // You can use this time dimension with all default granularities
      // and an additional custom granularity defined below
      granularities: {
        fiscal_year_starting_on_february_01: {
          interval: `1 year`,
          offset: `1 month`
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    dimensions:
      - name: created_at
        sql: created_at
        type: time
        # You can use this time dimension with all default granularities:
        # year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, minute, second

      - name: completed_at
        sql: completed_at
        type: time
        # You can use this time dimension with all default granularities
        # and an additional custom granularity defined below
        granularities:
          - name: fiscal_year_starting_on_february_01
            interval: 1 year
            offset: 1 month
```

</CodeTabs>

Time dimensions are essential to enabling performance boosts such as
[partitioned pre-aggregations][ref-caching-use-preaggs-partition-time] and
[incremental refreshes][ref-tutorial-incremental-preagg].

## Measures

_Measures_ represent the properties of a **set of data points** in the cube. To
add a measure called `count` to our `orders` cube, for example, we can do the
following:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count
```

</CodeTabs>

In our `LineItems` cube, we can also create a measure to sum up the total value
of line items sold:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`line_items`, {
  // ...

  measures: {
    total: {
      sql: `price`,
      type: `sum`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: line_items
    # ...

    measures:
      - name: total
        sql: price
        type: sum
```

</CodeTabs>

[Calculated measures][ref-calculated-measures] and [subquery dimensions][ref-subquery-dimensions]
can be used for measure composition. [Multi-stage calculations][ref-multi-stage-calculations]
enable data modeling of more sophisticated measures.

<ReferenceBox>

See the reference documentaton for the full list of measure [parameters][ref-measures].

</ReferenceBox>

### Measure types

Measures can be of different types, e.g., `count`, `sum`, or `number`. Often,
aggregate functions in SQL are mapped to measure types in the following way:

| Aggregate function in SQL | Measure type in Cube |
| --- | --- |
| `AVG` | [`avg`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#avg) |
| `BOOL_AND`, `BOOL_OR` | [`boolean`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#boolean) |
| `COUNT` | [`count`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#count) |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT …)` | [`count_distinct`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#count_distinct) |
| `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` | [`count_distinct_approx`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#count_distinct_approx) |
| `MAX` | [`max`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#max) |
| `MIN` | [`min`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#min) |
| `PERCENTILE_CONT`, `MEDIAN` | [`number`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#number) |
| `STRING_AGG`, `LISTAGG` | [`string`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#string) |
| `SUM` | [`sum`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#sum) |
| Any function returning a timestamp, e.g., `MAX(time)` | [`time`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#time) |

<ReferenceBox>

See the [measure type reference][ref-ref-measure-types] for details.

</ReferenceBox>

<ReferenceBox>

See the following recipes:
- To learn how to define [average and percentile measures][ref-avg-and-percentile-recipe],
- To learn how to calculate [period-over-period changes][ref-period-over-period-recipe].

</ReferenceBox>

### Measure additivity

Additivity is a property of measures that detemines whether measure values,
once calculated for a set of dimensions, can be further aggregated to calculate
measure values for a subset of these dimensions.

Measure additivity has an impact on [pre-aggregation
matching][ref-matching-preaggs].

Additivity of a measure depends on its [type](#measure-types). Only measures
with the following types are considered *additive*:
[`count`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#count),
[`count_distinct_approx`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#count_distinct_approx),
[`min`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#min),
[`max`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#max),
[`sum`](/product/data-modeling/reference/types-and-formats#sum).
Measures with all other types are considered *non-additive*.

#### Example

Consider the following cube:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: employees
    sql: >
      SELECT 1 AS id, 'Ali' AS first_name, 20 AS age, 'Los Gatos' AS city UNION ALL
      SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob' AS first_name, 30 AS age, 'San Diego' AS city UNION ALL
      SELECT 3 AS id, 'Eve' AS first_name, 40 AS age, 'San Diego' AS city

    measures:
      - name: count
        type: count

      - name: avg_age
        sql: age
        type: avg

    dimensions:
      - name: city
        sql: city
        type: string
```

```javascript
cube(`employees`, {
  sql: `
    SELECT 1 AS id, 'Ali' AS first_name, 20 AS age, 'Los Gatos' AS city UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, 'Bob' AS first_name, 30 AS age, 'San Diego' AS city UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, 'Eve' AS first_name, 40 AS age, 'San Diego' AS city
  `,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`
    },

    avg_age: {
      sql: `age`,
      type: `avg`
    }
  },

  dimensions: {
    city: {
      sql: `city`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
})
```

</CodeTabs>

If we run a query that includes `city` as a dimension and `count` and `avg_age`
as measures, we'll get the following results:

| city      | count | avg_age |    
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| Los Gatos | 1     | 20      |
| San Diego | 2     | 35      |

Then, if we remove the `city` dimension from the query, we'll get the following
results:

| count | avg_age |    
| ----- | ------- |
| 3     | 30      |

As you can see, the value of the `count` measure that we've got for the second
query could have been calculated based on the results of the first one:
`1 + 2 = 3`. It explains why the `count` measure, having the `count` type, is
considered *additive*.

However, the value of the `avg_age` measure that we've got for the second query
can't be calculated based on the results  of the first one: there's no way to
derive `30` from `20` and `35`. This is why the `avg_age` measure, having the
`avg` type, is considered *non-additive*.

### Leaf measures

Measures that do not [reference][ref-syntax-references] other measures are
considered *leaf measures*.

By definition, all measures that only reference SQL
[columns][ref-syntax-references-column] and expressions are *leaf measures*.
On the other hand, [calculated measures][ref-calculated-measures] might not
necessarily be *leaf measures* because they can reference other measures.

Whether a query contains only [additive](#measure-additivity) leaf measures has
an impact on [pre-aggregation matching][ref-matching-preaggs].

## Joins

_Joins_ define the relationships between cubes, which then allows accessing and
comparing properties from two or more cubes at the same time. In Cube, all joins
are `LEFT JOIN`s.

<InfoBox>

An `INNER JOIN` can be replicated with Cube; when making a Cube query, add a
filter for `IS NOT NULL` on the required column.

</InfoBox>

In the following example, we are left-joining the `line_items` cube onto our
`orders` cube:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  joins: {
    line_items: {
      relationship: `many_to_one`,
      // Here we use the `CUBE` global to refer to the current cube,
      // so the following is equivalent to `orders.id = line_items.order_id`
      sql: `${CUBE}.id = ${line_items.order_id}`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    joins:
      - name: line_items
        # Here we use the `CUBE` global to refer to the current cube,
        # so the following is equivalent to `orders.id = line_items.order_id`
        sql: "{CUBE}.id = {line_items.order_id}"
        relationship: many_to_one
```

</CodeTabs>

There are three types of join relationships (`one_to_one`, `one_to_many`, and
`many_to_one`) and a few [other concepts][ref-working-with-joins] such as the
direction of joins and transitive joins pitfalls.

<ReferenceBox>

See the reference documentaton for the full list of join [parameters][ref-joins].

</ReferenceBox>

## Segments

_Segments_ are pre-defined filters that are kept within the data model instead of
[a Cube query][ref-backend-query-filters]. They help to simplify queries and make
it easy to reuse common filters across a variety of queries.

To add a segment which limits results to completed orders, we can do the
following:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  segments: {
    only_completed: {
      sql: `${CUBE}.status = 'completed'`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    segments:
      - name: only_completed
        sql: "{CUBE}.status = 'completed'"
```

</CodeTabs>

<ReferenceBox>

See the reference documentaton for the full list of segment [parameters][ref-segments].

</ReferenceBox>

## Pre-aggregations

_Pre-aggregations_ provide a powerful way to accelerate frequently used queries
and keep the cache up-to-date. Within a data model, they are defined using the
`pre_aggregations` property:

<CodeTabs>

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  pre_aggregations: {
    main: {
      measures: [CUBE.count],
      dimensions: [CUBE.status],
      timeDimension: CUBE.created_at,
      granularity: `day`
    }
  }
})
```

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    pre_aggregations:
      - name: main
        measures:
          - count
        dimensions:
          - status
        time_dimension: created_at
        granularity: day
```

</CodeTabs>

A more thorough introduction can be found in [Getting Started with
Pre-Aggregations][ref-caching-preaggs-intro].

[parameters][ref-preaggs].
