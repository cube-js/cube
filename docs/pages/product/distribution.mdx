# Distribution

This page explains the difference between [Cube Core and Cube Cloud](#cube-core-and-cube-cloud),
provides links to ready-to-use [artifacts](#artifacts), and explains the
[versioning model](#versions) and the release cycle, including the [long-term
support](#long-term-support) (LTS). 

## Cube Core and Cube Cloud

_Cube Core_ is the universal semantic layer, developed by [Cube Dev][link-company]
and the community in open source under a permissive [Apache License 2.0][link-license].
You can find its [source code][link-repo] on GitHub.

_Cube Cloud_ is the managed platform for Cube Core, developed by Cube Dev as a
[commercial product][link-pricing]. It includes everything from Cube Core and
provides additional semantic layer features, [managed infrastructure][ref-infrastructure]
and [workspace tools][ref-workspace].

_Cube_ can be used to refer to both products if the distinction is not important
in a particular case.

<SuccessBox>

All Cube Cloud-specific features are marked with similar green boxes throughout
this documentation.

</SuccessBox>

You are welcome to either [sign up for Cube Cloud][link-sign-up] or
[self-host][ref-deployment] a Cube Core deployment.

## Artifacts

Cube Core is packaged and distributed as Docker images that you can run in a
containerized environment. You can find images for [Cube][link-dockerhub-cube]
and [Cube Store][link-dockerhub-cubestore] on Docker Hub.

Note that Cube Store images support the `linux/amd64` architecture while Cube
images support both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. The latter is convenient for
Mac computers with [Apple silicon][link-apple-silicon] that you might use to run
Cube locally.

Notably, the following tags are used with Docker images:
- `v1.1.0` and similar, one tag per each released version.
- `latest`, always pointing to the latest release.
- `dev`, always pointing to the bleeding-edge image built for the latest commit.

## Versions

Cube is actively developed, and new versions are released frequently.

Versions mostly follow [SemVer][link-semver] principles, with the only exception
that breaking changes can happen both in _major_ and _minor_ versions. Before
upgrading, it is recommended that you check the [release notes][link-releases]
on GitHub and read [changelog entries][link-changelog] in the blog.

<WarningBox>

You can find a list of currently [deprecated features][link-github-deprecation] on GitHub.
Usually, there are also deprecation notices in the documentation that look similar to this one.

</WarningBox>

Additionally, Cube Cloud provides [update channels][ref-update-channels] where
versions are marked as either <Btn>Stable</Btn> or <Btn>Latest</Btn>.

### Long-term support

To provide guarantees for the long-term support of Cube Core, some minor releases
are designated as _long-term support (LTS) releases_.

<InfoBox>

Check the [long-term support announcement][link-lts-accouncement] in the blog.

</InfoBox>

For 12 months after being marked as LTS, these releases receive fixes for defects
that significantly impact stability and functionality as well as the security
fixes for critical vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use the latest patch
version within an LTS release.

List of LTS releases:
