# Roles & Permissions

_Understanding user roles and permissions in Cube._

Cube has three built-in default roles: Admin, Developer, and Explorer. Each role has specific permissions and access levels designed to support different responsibilities within the platform.

The Enterprise tier allows creation of custom roles with a customized set of permissions tailored to your organization's specific needs.


## Default Roles

### Admin Role

- Has highest level of privileges
- Can manage semantic models
- Can manage other users
- Has access to admin section
- Full query capabilities

<InfoBox>
Admin roles are billed at the developer rate.
</InfoBox>

### Developer Role

- Can create and edit semantic models
- Can execute SQL queries against data sources
- Can create and edit workbooks
- Can create and edit data apps
- No access to admin settings

### Explorer Role

- Can query semantic models
- Can create and edit workbooks
- Can create and edit data apps
- Can execute Semantic SQL queries
- Cannot make changes to semantic models
- Cannot query source data directly

## Future Implementation

A Viewer role is planned for future implementation with the following capabilities:

- Use Analytics Chat with ability to query Semantic Views and existing reports
- View (read-only) access to shared data apps

## Agent Permissions

Agents are connected to Semantic Model Deployments and inherit the permission level of the user they are operating under.

Each agent can be configured to use the _Restrict Views_ feature which allows to select the views that are visible to the agent.
This feature should not be used as a security measure. Configure [access policies][ref-data-access-policies] instead.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

- Explorers: Typically data consumers and analysts
- Developers: Usually data stewards and data engineers
- Admins: Typically assigned to data engineers managing the entire Cube instance (billed at the developer rate with additional privileges)
