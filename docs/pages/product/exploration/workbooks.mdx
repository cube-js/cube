# Workbooks

Workbooks allow you to build reports with an AI agent, organize the results of your
analysis, and share insights with your team.

## Tabs

Workbooks can contain one or more tabs, each providing a different way to query and analyze your data. Tabs enable you to organize multiple analyses within a single workbook, making it easy to explore different aspects of your data or combine insights from different sources.

## Tab types

Workbooks support two types of tabs, each designed for different querying approaches:

### Semantic Query

[Semantic Query tabs](/product/exploration/workbooks/querying-data) allow you to query your data model through the semantic layer. This ensures all queries use consistent metrics, respect access control policies, and benefit from pre-aggregations for fast performance.

You can query the semantic layer in three ways:

- **Point and click** – Use the intuitive interface to select measures and dimensions, build visualizations, and explore your data interactively
- **AI agent** – Ask the AI agent to build queries and visualizations based on natural language questions
- **Semantic SQL** – Write Semantic SQL queries manually to have full control over your queries while still leveraging the semantic layer

### Source SQL Query

[Source SQL Query tabs](/product/exploration/workbooks/source-sql-tabs) allow you to query your connected data sources directly, bypassing the semantic layer. This gives you direct access to your raw data and enables deeper exploration beyond what's defined in your data model.

You can query source SQL in two ways:

- **Write SQL manually** – Write standard SQL queries directly against your data source for maximum flexibility
- **Ask AI** – Use the AI agent to help you research your data source, build SQL queries, and refine results in real-time
