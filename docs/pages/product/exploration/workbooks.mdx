## Query data

The Data Pane in Cube workbooks provides an intuitive interface for exploring and
querying your data models, giving you direct access to all available semantic views
along with their measures and dimensions.

## Source SQL

The Source SQL capability in Cube workbooks allows you to query your connected data
sources directly, beyond just the semantic layer. Our AI agent can research your data
source, help you build SQL queries, and refine results in real-time to provide deeper
insights and exploration capabilities.

## Charts

### Chart templates

Cube provides quick chart templates that make it faster to create common visualizations.
These templates automatically map the right data fields and apply best practices for
each visualization type.

Charts in Cube workbooks provide powerful visualization capabilities for your data
models, enabling you to create interactive and insightful visual representations of your
analytics.

### Table chart

Table charts provide a tabular view of your data, perfect for detailed data exploration
and when you need to see exact values rather than visual trends.
