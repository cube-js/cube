# Analytics Chat

Analytics Chat is a conversational interface that allows you to explore your data using natural language. Ask questions and get AI-powered insights without writing queries or building visualizations manually.

## How it works

The AI agent interprets your questions, generates queries against your semantic model, and presents findings in natural language. The agent can create multiple queries to answer complex questions and perform ad hoc analysis while maintaining full data governance through your semantic layer.

## Key features

- **Natural language queries** – Ask questions in plain language without knowing SQL
- **Multi-query reasoning** – The AI creates and synthesizes multiple queries for complex questions
- **Semantic model integration** – All queries run against your semantic model with proper access control and security
- **Save to Workbook** – Export insights to [Workbooks](/product/exploration/workbooks) for further analysis

## Embedding

Analytics Chat can be [embedded](/product/presentation/embedding) into your applications for customer-facing analytics, internal tools, or white-label solutions.
