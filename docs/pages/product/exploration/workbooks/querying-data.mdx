# Querying data

In the Semantic Query tab, you can query the semantic layer. On the left, there is a selector for the semantic view that you want to query.

On the left side, you can select a semantic view you would like to query. Inside the semantic view, you can see the measures and dimensions grouped either by cubes or folders. You can search within your semantic view to find the relevant member.

## Filtering

Dimensions and measures can be added as filters to focus on specific rows of data.

## Pivoting

You can add dimensions to the pivot by right-clicking on the left pane or in the results header.

Note that chart tables are different from results tables. You can configure pivots in chart tables separately.

## Limiting

By default, queries are limited to 5,000 rows of data, but the limit can be adjusted up to 50,000.

## Sorting

You can sort results by clicking on dimensions or measures in the left pane or table header.


## Advanced semantic queries

Advanced semantic queries typically can contain CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and unions, and can contain multiple semantic views. In many cases for advanced semantic queries, the interactive components of the UI would be disabled—not the whole UI—as these complex queries require manual SQL editing.

Currently, advanced semantic queries can be placed on dashboards, but dashboard filters cannot be applied to advanced semantic queries.
