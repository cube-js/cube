# Source SQL Tabs

Source SQL Query tabs allow you to query your connected data sources directly, bypassing the semantic layer. Source SQL Query tabs can be used for prototyping your calculations before they would go into the semantic layer.

## Querying methods

You can query source SQL in two ways:

- **Write SQL manually** – Write standard SQL queries directly against your data source for maximum flexibility
- **Ask AI** – Use the AI agent to help you research your data source, build SQL queries, and refine results in real-time
