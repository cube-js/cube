# Playground

Playground is a web-based tool that helps validate the data model by executing
[queries][ref-queries] and previewing their results. It is supposed to be used
by data engineers and developers while building the [data model][ref-data-modeling].
If you'd like to let end users query the data, [connect a BI tool][ref-dataviz-tools]
or use the [JavaScript SDKs][ref-js-sdk] to build your own query builder.

<SuccessBox>

Playground is available in Cube Cloud on
[all product tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

<InfoBox>

Playground is available in Cube Core at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
when it's run in the [development mode][ref-dev-mode].

</InfoBox>

You can [view](#viewing-the-data-model) the data model entities or [search](#searching-the-data-model)
for them, [compose](#composing-queries) a query from scratch or [paste](#pasting-a-query)
an exsiting query, view [results](#viewing-results), check a [generated
query](#viewing-a-generated-query), or copy equivalent [queries for data APIs](#copying-api-queries).

## Viewing the data model

You can see a list of all cubes or views in the sidebar on the left. Choose either
<Btn>Cubes</Btn> or <Btn>Views</Btn> to switch between cubes and views and click
on a cube or a view to view a list of its members.

/>

Members of cubes and views (i.e., measures, dimensions, hierarchies, etc.) are shown
using distinct colors and icons. If a member has
a [title][ref-data-model-title] or a [description][ref-data-model-description] set
in the data model, they will be shown in a tooltip. If a member is not
[public][ref-data-model-public], you will see a lock sign next to it.

<InfoBox>

Even if a cube, a view, or their member is not public, Playground would still allow
you to query and validate it.

</InfoBox>

### Switching the security context

You can click on the <Btn>Security Context</Btn> button in the top right corner to
change the security context. Changing the security context can affect the contents
of the sidebar that you see:

## Searching the data model

You can search for cubes, views, and their members using the search bar in the
sidebar on the left. Click on the element in the search results to add it to a new
or existing query.

<Screenshot

  src="https://ucarecdn.com/c9e3a8e5-d9f5-4a15-82c1-859bbebd8493/"
/>

## Composing queries

You can compose a new query by selecting desired measures, dimensions, and segments
in the sidebar on the left. Click on the _funnel_ icon next to any member to add a filter
for it to the query.

Click <Btn>All members</Btn> or <Btn>Used members</Btn> to show only members of the
query or all available members. Click <Btn>Reset</Btn> to remove all members from the query.

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(7.5% 74% 1% 4% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/1f052da4-1e7d-46c0-98b5-616eabbaa128/"
/>

Use the <Btn>Order</Btn> drop-down on the right to specify how the
[results](/product/workspace/playground#viewing-results) shall be sorted.

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(35% 9% 15% 64% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/82719c33-8881-42c6-9353-acd2e678014b/"
/>

Use the <Btn>Options</Btn> drop-down on the right to specify if the query shall be
[ungrouped][ref-ungrouped-query], to set a [time zone][ref-time-zone], or to set
a [row limit][ref-row-limit] and an offset.

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(35% 0 15% 80% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/92dac6aa-f260-4ee3-9065-f1b29fe0d99f/"
/>

### Pasting a query

You can also compose a new query by clicking on the _pencil_ button in the sidebar on the
left and pasting a [REST API][ref-rest-api] query or a [GraphQL API][ref-graphql-api]
query from the clipboard and clicking <Btn>Apply</Btn>.

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/d34949a1-40a7-4cb5-b180-efa63f94b201/" />

Pasting a [SQL API][ref-sql-api] query is not supported.

### Using query tabs

You can use query tabs to keep results of previous queries while still being
able to make new queries. Previous queries are kept in the local storage in your browser
and will be restored when you open Playground once again.

You can also double-click on a query tab to give it a meaningful name.

## Viewing results

Click <Btn>Run Query</Btn> on the top to run (or re-run) the query and check the
querying time in the top right corner. Click on the querying time to open [Rollup
Designer][ref-rollup-designer] that would help you create a pre-aggregation
to accelerate the query.

View query results on the <Btn>Results</Btn> tab. Check the number of rows in the result
set on the bottom and use the pagination control in the bottom right corner, if needed.

  src="https://ucarecdn.com/399016dc-06de-4652-a86f-ca98f944725e/"
/>

Expand the <Btn>Chart</Btn> pane to visualize the results. Choose one of visualization
types and pivot data via the <Btn>Pivot</Btn> drop-down, if needed. Click <Btn>Code</Btn>
to generate front-end code in [Chart Prototyping][ref-chart-prototyping].

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(7.5% 0 0 26% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/368ceb39-c3b9-45c4-8a7a-873cee571d69/"
/>

## Viewing a generated query

View the SQL query that Cube did (or will) run against the data source to get the results
on the <Btn>Generated SQL</Btn> tab. Click <Btn>Copy</Btn> to put it into your clipboard.

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(7.5% 0 0 26% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/d2b6e514-9219-49ea-bae6-bcd0f1936542/"
/>

<InfoBox>

Note that a generated query can contain placeholders, e.g., `?` or `$1`, for parameters
that Cube passes to an underlying data source driver later when executing the query.

</InfoBox>

## Copying API queries

View the queries for respective data APIs on the <Btn>SQL API</Btn>, <Btn>REST API</Btn>,
and <Btn>GraphQL API</Btn> tabs. Click <Btn>Copy</Btn> to put one of them into your clipboard.

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(7.5% 0 0 26% round 10px)"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/1b32fe0d-9a2a-4251-a650-6226a3006e86/"

You can use this Playground to view and [generate data model][ref-data-model]
files.

<WarningBox>

Data model generator currently has the following limitations:
- Even if [multiple data sources][ref-multiple-data-sources] are configured,
it will only show the tables from in default data source. As a workaround, you
can configure the second data source as default, generate data model files for
it, then change the default data source back.
- With each generation, files in the data model folder will be rewritten. If
you'd like to combine files from multiple generations, please back them up
manually. 

</WarningBox>
