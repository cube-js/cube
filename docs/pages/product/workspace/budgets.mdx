# Budgets

As an account administrator, you can define rules which trigger notifications
when your account's usage exceeds a certain threshold. These rules are called
"budgets".

Budgets are available in Cube Cloud on
[Premium and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) tiers.

## How budgets work

Budgets are configured on a per-account basis. When a budget is triggered, any configured users
will receive an email notification. Budget notifications are sent immediately after being triggered.

## List all budgets

To see a list of all configured budgets in your account, first go to the Billing settings page by
clicking on your avatar in the top right corner, then clicking on <Btn>Billing</Btn>.

On the Billing settings page, click the <Btn>Budgets</Btn> tab to see all configured budgets in your
account:

## Create a budget

To create a new budget, click the <Btn>Add Budget</Btn> button. Enter a name for the budget,
then select a time period (either 'Daily' or 'Monthly') and a corresponding target amount, which
is the amount of usage that will trigger a notification.

### Threshold Rules

You can also configure threshold rules, which allow you to trigger notifications when usage
exceeds a certain percentage of the target amount. For example, if you set a target amount of
\$1,000 and a threshold of 80%, you will also receive a notification when your usage exceeds \$800.

<InfoBox>

A good rule-of-thumb for accounts that pay annually is to set a monthly budget of 1/12 (~8.3%) for your first budget.

</InfoBox>

If you have multiple thresholds defined, some thresholds __may not be triggered__ if a higher threshold
is triggered first. For example, if you have a target amount of \$1,000 and thresholds of 80% and 90%,
and your usage hits 95%, you will only receive a notification when your usage exceeds \$900.

### Managing Notifications

When creating a new budget, by default, all users will receive email notifications.

You can also specify particular users who should receive alerts by
toggling the **Specific users** option and selecting them. Optionally,
you can also add additional email addresses that should receive
email notifications by entering the email address in the **Custom email** field.
