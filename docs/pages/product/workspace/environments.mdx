# Environments

An environment provides access to your data model. Cube Cloud provides the following environments:
- production (default)
- staging - providing access to the data model on a specific branch.
  Each branch in the repository corresponds to a separate staging environment.
  Changes must be committed to a branch to be viewable in this environment.
- development - providing access to the data model that you are currently working on.
  The development environment is automatically created when you enter [development mode][ref-dev-mode].
  One development environment is allocated per user.
  It tracks the branch you're currently on and is updated automatically when you save changes to the data model.
  You cannot query the development enviornment unless your user is in dev mode on the branch you are trying to access.

## Staging Environments
Staging environments are created for each branch in your repository. By default, these environments are only accessible when the branch is being viewed on the Data Model screen by at least one user. When no users are viewing the branch, the environment becomes inactive and inaccessible.

To maintain continuous access to a staging environment regardless of user activity, you can use the "Always Active" toggle in Settings > Staging Environments. Here's how it works:

- Toggle OFF (default): The environment is only accessible when users are viewing the branch. When no users are viewing the branch, queries to this environment will fail.
- Toggle ON: The environment remains active and accessible 24/7, regardless of user activity.

### Cost Implications
Please note that staging environments consume resources only when they are being used:
- Environments automatically suspend after 10 minutes of inactivity, regardless of the "Always Active" toggle setting
- You are only charged for the time when environments are being used

Therefore, the "Always Active" toggle only affects accessibility to inactive branches and does not impact your costs directly.

## API Endpoints
Each environment provides its own set of API and SQL API endpoints.
You can reference them on the [Data Model][ref-data-model]'s Overview page and <Btn>BI Integrations</Btn> SQL API Connection tab.
To query a development environment's API endpoints, your user must be in dev mode and on the branch that has the saved changes.
