# Environments

An environment provides access to your data model. Cube Cloud provides the following environments:
- production (default)
- staging - providing access to the data model on a specific branch.
  Each branch in the repository corresponds to a separate staging environment.
- development - providing access to the data model that you are currently working on.
  The development environment is automatically created when you enter [development mode][ref-dev-mode].
  It tracks the branch you're on and is updated automatically when you make changes to the data model.

Each environment provides its own set of API and SQL API endpoints.
You can access them on the [Data Model][ref-data-model]'s Overview page and <Btn>BI Integrations<Btn> SQL API Connection tab.
