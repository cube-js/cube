# Performance Insights

<WarningBox>

This page is work-in-progress.

</WarningBox>

The&nbsp;<Btn>Performance</Btn> page in Cube Cloud displays charts that help
analyze the performance of your deployment and fine-tune its configuration.
It's recommended to review Performance Insights when the workload changes
or if you face any performance-related issues with your deployment.

<SuccessBox>

Performance Insights are available in Cube Cloud on
[all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

## Charts

Charts provide insights into different aspects of your deployment.

### API instances

The&nbsp;<Btn>API instances</Btn> chart shows the number of API instances
that served queries to the deployment over time.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot */}

You can use this chart to fine-tune the auto-scaling configuration of API
instances, e.g., increase the minimum and maximum number of API instances. 

Also, you can use this chart to fine-tune the auto-suspension configuration,
e.g., by turning auto-suspension off or increasing the auto-suspension
threshold.

### Data sources

The&nbsp;<Btn>Requests by data source</Btn> chart shows the number of API
requests that were fulfilled by using cache or querying the upstream data
source over time. The&nbsp;<Btn>Avg. response time by data source</Btn>
shows the difference in the response time for
requests that hit the cache or go to the upstream data source.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot (x2) */}

You can use these charts to see if you'd like to have more queries that hit
the cache and have lower response time. In that case, consider adding more
pre-aggregations in Cube Store or fine-tune the existing ones.

### Data model compilation

The&nbsp;<Btn>Requests by data model compilation</Btn> chart shows the
number of API requests that had or had not to wait for the data model
compilation. The&nbsp;<Btn>Wait time for data model compilation</Btn> chart
shows the total time requests had to wait for the data model compilation.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot */}

You can use these charts to identify multitenancy misconfiguration,
fine-tune the auto-suspension configuration, or consider using a
multi-cluster deployment.

### Cube Store

The&nbsp;<Btn>Saturation for queries by Cube Store workers</Btn> chart
shows if Cube Store workers are overloaded with serving **queries**. High
saturation for queries prevents Cube Store workers from fulfilling requests
and results in wait time displayed at the&nbsp;<Btn>Wait time for queries
by Cube Store workers</Btn> chart.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot */}

Similarly, the&nbsp;<Btn>Saturation for jobs by Cube Store workers</Btn>
and <Btn>Wait time for jobs by Cube Store workers</Btn> charts show if
Cube Store Workers are overloaded with serving **jobs**, i.e., building
pre-aggregations or performing internal tasks such as data compaction.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot */}

You can use these charts to consider fine-tuning the number of Cube Store
workers used by your deployment.
