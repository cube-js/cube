# Semantic Catalog

Semantic Catalog lets users search, understand, and re-use trusted data products,
both from Cube and external sources such as cloud data warehouses and business intelligence tools.

<SuccessBox>

Semantic Catalog is available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.
You can also choose a [Semantic Catalog tier](/product/deployment/cloud/pricing#semantic-catalog-tiers).

## Configuration

### Enabling Semantic Catalog

Navigate to <Btn>Catalog</Btn> in the left sidebar and click a button to get started.

In a few moments, your data model will sync to the Semantic Catalog, and
you will see cubes, views, and data source tables appear in the Semantic Catalog.

### Connecting downstream tools

In addition to your Cube data model, Semantic Catalog can be used to understand charts and dashboards in downstream business intelligence and data visualization tools.
These currently include:

- [Tableau][ref-tableau]
- [Superset][ref-superset]
- [Preset][ref-superset]
- Amazon QuickSight

To connect these, navigate to "Settings" in your Cube deployment sidebar, and then choose "Catalog Services."
Click the "Add Service" button, and a modal will pop up for you to enter credentials, test the connection, and create your service.

## Usage

### Overview

You can search and filter for data assets such as Cubes, Views, tables, charts, and dashboards.
Semantic Catalog will show you an overview of each data asset, including information such as name,
description, the measures and dimensions included (for a Cube or View), and usage information.

### Lineage

Semantic Catalog can be used to explore lineage between your connected data assets.
For example, for a View, users can see what tables and Cubes flow into it as well as the downstream
dashboards that query it in tools such as Tableau and Superset.
