# Visual Model

Visual Model editor provides the visual, no-code experience for building and enhancing
the [data model][ref-data-modeling] of your semantic layer from within your web browser.

Unlike the code-first [data model][ref-data-model] editor, Visual Model allows non-technical
users to participate in data modeling without writing code. However, it does not support
some advanced data modeling features listed as known [limitations](#limitations).

<SuccessBox>

Visual Model is available in Cube Cloud on
[Premium and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.

</SuccessBox>

<InfoBox>

Visual Model extends and replaces the [Data Graph](https://cube.dev/blog/introducing-data-graph)
feature.

## Prerequisites

Visual Model integrates with the [development mode][ref-dev-mode],
[environments][ref-environments], and [continuous deployment][ref-continuous-deployment]
in Cube Cloud.

Once you start editing the data model in Visual Model editor, you will automatically
enter the development mode, so you can safely make changes and test them in
[Playground][ref-playground] without affecting your production deployment.

When you are ready to deploy your changes, it is recommended to create a pull request,
which should be reviewed before merging to the production environment.

## Working with cubes

You can see [cubes][ref-cubes] on the <Btn>Cubes</Btn> tab of Visual Model.

Cubes are represented as rectangles on the canvas with [joins][ref-joins] between them as
an [entity-relationship diagram][wiki-erd] (ERD). You can pan and zoom the canvas and
search cubes using the input box.

### Adding cubes

To add a cube from scratch, click the <Btn>+ Add Cube</Btn> button.

You can also generate the data model for a new cube based on the database schema.
To do so, click the <Btn>+ Generate Cube</Btn> button. It will bring up the
modal window where you can select a table from your data source:

### Editing cubes

To edit a cube, click it on the canvas. Then, in the sidebar, click the <Btn>Edit</Btn>
button. This will bring up the modal window where you can edit the cube's details:

  alt="Edit cube dialog"
/>

Yu can also click <Btn>+ Add → Dimension</Btn>, <Btn>+ Add → Measure</Btn>, or
<Btn>+ Add → Access Policy</Btn> to quickly add respective members to the cube.

### Working with joins

You can add or edit joins via the <Btn>Relationships</Btn> tab while you're
[editing a cube](#editing-cube).

You can also add joins visually by dragging a line on the canvas from the side of one
dimension to another:

## Working with views

You can see views on the <Btn>Views</Btn> tab of Visual Model.

Views are represented as rectangles on the canvas. Cubes that are involved in a view
and provide members for it, are shown to the left of the view.

### Adding views

To add a view, click the <Btn>+ Add View</Btn> button. It will bring up a dialog where you
can choose the base cube, set the view details such as name and title, and add join paths.

### Editing views

To edit a views, click it on the canvas. Then, in the sidebar, click the <Btn>Edit</Btn>
button.

## YAML mode

All modal windows mentioned above provide the option to use the _YAML mode_ which can be
entered by clicking the <Btn>Edit with YAML</Btn> button.

In this mode, you can see and edit the data model represented using the [YAML syntax][ref-yaml-syntax].
That allows you to work around known [limitations](#limitations) and use all data modeling
features while staying in Visual Model editor.

## Limitations

Visual Model does not intend to support all available data modeling features.
You always have options to use the [YAML mode](#yaml-mode) in Visual Model or switch the
code-first [data model editor][ref-data-model].

Currently, Visual Model does not support the following features in its UI:

* Editing of [meta information][ref-meta] for cubes, views, and their members.
* Editing [segments][ref-segments], [hierarchies][ref-hierarchies], and [refresh keys][ref-refresh-keys] in cubes.
* Editing [folders][ref-folders] in views.
* Adding [subquery dimensions][ref-sub-query] and time dimensions with [custom granularities][ref-granularities] in cubes.
* Adding [drill members][ref-drill-members] and [rolling window][ref-rolling-window] measures in cubes.
* Adding [pre-aggregations][ref-pre-aggregations].
* Removing cubes and views.

Cubes and views using these data modeling features will still be displayed in
Visual Model. However, those features can only be edited via the [YAML mode](#yaml-mode)
or in the code-forst data model editor.

Additionally, Visual Model only allows editing of cubes and views that are
defined using the [YAML syntax][ref-yaml-syntax] (not JavaScript). Also, it does not
allow editing of [dynamic data models][ref-dynamic-data-models] or models which use
[Jinja][ref-jinja].
