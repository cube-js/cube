# Chart Prototyping

Chart Prototyping generates code of a front-end application that works with
the [REST API][ref-rest-api] and visualizes data on charts. It's convenient
for boostrapping a new embedded analytics application or copying and pasting
code to an existing one.

Chart Prototyping is available in Cube Cloud on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

To access Chart Prototyping, go to [Playground][ref-playground], compose and
run a query, expand the <Btn>Chart</Btn> pane, and click <Btn>Code</Btn> on
the right:

## Preview the chart

Chart Prototyping shows you a preview of the chart on the <Btn>Preview</Btn>
tab:

You can also customize the chart by choosing a visualization type,
a framework, a charting library, or one of other options in the sidebar.

If you'd like to request the support for a specific charting library or
framework, please [contact us](http://cube.dev/contact).

## Browse the code

You can also browse the generated code of this application on the
<Btn>Code</Btn> tab:

## Download the application

Finally, you can download a ZIP archive with the code and the file with your
Cube Cloud credentials using the buttons on the bottom of the <Btn>Code</Btn>
tab:

<Screenshot

  highlight="inset(87.5% 78.5% 2.5% 2.5% round 10px)"  
/>

First, unarchive the code. Then, rename the credentials file to `.env.local`
(so that it starts with a dot) and place it into the folder with unarchived code.
You can now run the application with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
