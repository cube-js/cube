# Data Model

With the web-based data model editor, you can write and test and your Cube [data
model][ref-data-modeling] from your browser.

<SuccessBox>

Data model editor is available in Cube Cloud on
[all product tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

Cube Cloud can create branch-based development API instances to quickly test
changes in the data model in your frontend applications before pushing them into
production.

## Development Mode

In development mode, you can safely make changes to your project without
affecting production deployment. Development mode uses a separate Git branch and
allows testing your changes in Playground or via a separate API endpoint
specific to this branch. This development API hot-reloads your data model
changes, allowing you to quickly test API changes from your applications.

To enter development mode, navigate to the <Btn>Data Model</Btn> screen and
click <Btn>Dev Mode</Btn>.

  alt="Entering dev mode"
/>

If you are entering development mode from the main branch, you will be asked to
choose an existing branch or create a new one. You can configure whether it's possible
to commit directly to the main branch in the deployment settings.

  alt="Entering dev mode modal"
/>

When development mode is active, the status of the development API will be shown
at the top of the screen. After any changes to the project, the API
will hot-reload, and the API status will indicate when it's ready.

You can exit development mode by clicking <Btn>Dev Mode X</Btn> in the purple banner. If
you've been editing a data model and navigate away, Cube Cloud will warn you if
there are any unsaved changes:

## Data Graph

<InfoBox>
  For Cube Cloud customers on the [Enterprise](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier, 
  the Data Graph is replaced by [Visual Modeler][ref-visual-modeler].
  Please see the [Visual Modeler page][ref-visual-modeler] for more details.
</InfoBox> 

In addition to exploring the code of data model files, you can view the visual
representation of the data model, including relations between cubes.
Click <Btn>Show Graph</Btn> in the top right part of the data model editor to
open Data Graph:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/30b7fa8c-fb9f-43fb-af1d-4ef98aae2829/" />

Data Graph visualizes [cubes][ref-cubes] and [joins][ref-joins] between them as
an [entity-relationship diagram][wiki-erd] (ERD). It allows to have a bird's-eye
view of the data model and visually detect connected parts, i.e., groups of
cubes that don't have any relationships with other groups.

For clarity, only dimensions and custom SQL expressions used in joins are shown.
Join [relationship types][ref-join-types] are depicted with the crow's foot
notation:

- Dash represents `one` in `one_to_one` and `one_to_many` types
- Crow's foot represents `many` in `one_to_many` and `many_to_one` types

You can pan and zoom the visualization, search cubes using the input box, hover
over cubes to highlight their relationships, and click <Btn>Show Code</Btn> to
view their code.

## Git integration

To add more Git branches to your Cube Cloud deployment and/or switch between
them, click the branch name in the status bar:

<Screenshot

  alt="Branch switcher"
/>

Speaking of Git branches, you can now easily add and remove branches with the
same switcher; click <Btn>Add Branch</Btn> and enter a name for the new branch
in the popup:

<Screenshot
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/15ea528f-4a54-40a1-83c7-2f67738a3e8b/"
  alt="Create a new branch"
/>

These branches are shared, meaning everyone who has access to the deployment can
see and edit them. This makes them extremely useful for out-of-band experiments
where you can quickly test things in Cube Cloud without having to go through a
CI/CD process.

Unused branches can also be deleted. Ensure you are already on the branch you
want to delete, then open the switcher and click <Btn>Remove Branch</Btn>:

  alt="Delete a branch"

## Generating data model files

You can generate data model files when [creating a new
deployment][ref-creating-deployment] or at later moment. To open the data model
wizard, click on the <Btn>...</Btn> button on the right and select <Btn>Generate
data model</Btn>:

<Screenshot

  src="https://ucarecdn.com/0f9684c2-a7f5-48a2-9fac-32e050beba5d/"
/>

It is safe to generate data model files for tables that already have matching cubes.
In that case, existing files will be renamed by appending `.backup` to their names.
You would also be able to review changes to files on the <Btn>Changes</Btn> tab:

## Creating pre-aggregations

If you'd like to use the UI to create a pre-aggregation, you can click on the
<Btn>...</Btn> button on the right and select <Btn>Add rollup</Btn> to open
[Rollup Designer][ref-rollup-designer]:
