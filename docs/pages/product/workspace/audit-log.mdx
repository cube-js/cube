# Audit Log

Audit Log collects, stores, and displays security-related events within a Cube Cloud
account, across all deployments. You can use it to maintain and review a historical
record of activity for compliance purposes.

<SuccessBox>

Audit Log is available in Cube Cloud on the
[Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tier.
You can also choose an [Audit Log tier](/product/deployment/cloud/pricing#audit-log-tiers).

Read below about [collected events](#event-types). Also, see how you can [enable](#configuration)
Audit Log, [view events](#viewing-events), and [download](#downloading-events) them.

## Viewing events

### Table view

Audit Log displays events in a table with the following information for each event:
- Event timestamp in your local time zone.
- User email, if applicable to a particular event.
- Event name (see [event types](#event-types) for the full list).
- Deployment name, if applicable to a particular event.

### Extended view

You can click on any event to view extended information:
- IP address from which an event was initiated.
- Event-specific attributes.

#### Sanitization

Audit Log uses heuristics to detect sensitive values (e.g., passwords and tokens)
and sanitize them, i.e., replace them with `[HIDDEN]` in event-specific
attributes. You can see that a password was sanitized on the screenshot above.

If you'd like your custom environment variable to be sanitized, include one of
the following substrings in its name: `PASS`, `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `KEY`.

### Filters

You can also customize the table view with filters on the top and in the right sidebar:
- Text input for full-text search.
- Date range filter.
- Filters to narrow the view down to a specific user, event, or deployment.
