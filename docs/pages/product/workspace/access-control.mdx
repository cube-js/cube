# Access Control

As a Cube Cloud account administrator, you can define roles with specific permissions
for Cube Cloud resources and apply those roles to users within the account.

<SuccessBox>

Access control is available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.

</SuccessBox>

You can [manage accounts](#managing-accounts) as an account administrator,
[manage roles](#managing-roles), [assign them](#assigning-roles-to-users) to users,
and associate [supported actions](#actions) with those roles.

## Managing accounts

Account administrators have ultimate control over the Cube Cloud account, including
[managing roles](#managing-roles) and assigning them to users.

You can see which users are account administrators on the <Btn>Members</Btn> tab of the
<Btn>Team & Security</Btn> page in your Cube Cloud. Account administrators have the
<Btn>Admin</Btn> toggle enabled next to their name.

## Managing roles

In Cube Cloud, users are not assigned permissions directly. Instead, they are assigned
_roles_ that are associated with _policies_. Each policy define what _actions_ they can
perform and on what _resources_ they can perform those actions. This approach makes it
easier to manage permissions at scale.

Each role can be associated with one or more of the following policies:

| Policy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Global` | Controls account-level functionality, e.g., as Billing. |
| `Deployment` | Controls deployment-level functionality, e.g., as Playground. |
| `Report` | Controls access to specific reports in Saved Reports. |
| `ReportFolder` | Controls access to specific folders in Saved Reports. |

Each policy can apply to _all resources_ or _specific resources_. For example, a policy
could apply to all deployments or only to a specific deployment.

Also, each policy can have _all actions_ or only _specific actions_ associated with it.
For example, a policy could allow a user to view, create, or delete one or more
deployments if it's associated with those specific actions.

See [actions reference](#actions) for a list of available actions.

### Browsing roles

To see a list of roles, go to the <Btn>Team & Security</Btn> page in your Cube Cloud
account, then navigate to the <Btn>Roles</Btn> tab:

/>

### Creating a role

To create a new role, click the <Btn>Add Role</Btn> button. Enter a name and an optional
description for the role, then click <Btn>Add Policy</Btn> and select either <Btn>Deployment</Btn>
or <Btn>Global</Btn> for this policy's scope.

Deployment policies apply to deployment-level functionality, such as the
Playground and Data Model editor. Global policies apply to account-level
functionality, such as Billing. Once the policy scope has been
selected, you can restrict which actions this role can perform by selecting
"Specific" and using the dropdown to select specific actions.
