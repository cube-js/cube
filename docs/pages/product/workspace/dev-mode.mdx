# Development mode

Development mode allows to test and debug the data model in an isolated
environment before releasing any changes to production. When the development
mode is enabled, you'll have access to your personal API endpoints that will track the branch you're on and will be updated automatically when you make changes to the data model.
Read more about environments on the [Environments][ref-environments] page.

Development mode is available in Cube Cloud on
[all product tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

## Development flow

### Save changes

When you make changes to the data model, you can save them by clicking the "Save all" button in the actions bar at the top of the screen.

### Commit & Sync

After saving changes, you can commit them to the branch you're working on by clicking the "Commit & Sync" button in the actions bar.

  alt="Commit & Sync modal"

### Merge or Create a Pull Request

After committing changes, you can merge them into the parent branch or create a pull request by clicking the "Merge" or "Create a Pull Request" button in the actions bar.

  alt="Merge modal"
/>

### Updating the branch

When there are changes in the parent branch, you can update your active branch by pulling changes from the parent branch.
If your active branch got updated in the connected repository, you can update it by pulling changes from the remote.

### Resolving conflicts
In some cases, you may encounter conflicts when merging or pulling changes from the parent branch or remote.
If this happens, you'll see a warning about conflicts in the actions bar.
You'll then be able to either resolve them manually or discard the changes.

## Finding endpoints

In Development Mode, you'll have dedicated endpoints that will track the branch you're on.
They will be shown on the Overview page:

    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

Read more about the available endpoints on the [Environments][ref-environments] page.

## Limitations

The Development API has some limitations compared to Production, and it is
important to be aware of these as they may affect your development process.

### Autoscaling

The Development API **does not** support autoscaling. If you need to test
autoscaling, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a different Git
branch of the same repository.

### Scheduled refresh

Scheduled refresh is also disabled in the Development API. If you need to test
scheduled refreshes, we recommend creating a separate deployment using a
different Git branch of the same repository.

### Cube version guarantees

The version of Cube used in the Development API **is not** guaranteed to be the
same each time. If this affects your development process, we recommend reaching
out to our support team.
