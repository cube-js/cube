## Identifying slow queries

You can identify queries that might be accelerated with pre-aggregations in
[Playground][ref-playground] and [Query History][ref-query-history].

You can also access Rollup Designer from [Data Model][ref-data-model].

### Playground

When you execute a query in [Playground][ref-playground] that has no matching
pre-aggregations, you would see this notificaton. Clicking on it will open
Rollup Designer with a suggested pre-aggregation:

/>

### Query History

When you browse a query in [Query History][ref-query-history] that has no matching
pre-aggregations, you would see this notificaton. Clicking on <Btn>Accelerate</Btn>
will open Rollup Designer with a suggested pre-aggregation:

<Screenshot
  highlight="inset(37.5% 0 37.5% 5% round 10px)"

## Creating pre-aggregations

When you open Rollup Designer from Playground or Query History, it will suggest
a pre-aggregation accelerating the query in question:

If desired, you can also modify settings such as the [refresh
key][ref-preaggs-ref-refreshkey], the [partition
granularity][ref-preaggs-ref-partitiongranularity], and
[indexes][ref-preaggs-ref-indexes] to further optimize the pre-aggregation by
clicking the ​<Btn>Settings</Btn> tab:

Click <Btn>Add to the Data Model</Btn> to add the pre-aggregation to the data
model.
