# Integration with Amazon S3

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a popular object storage system.
This guide demonstrates how to set up Cube Cloud to export logs to Amazon S3.

## Configuration

First, enable [monitoring integrations][ref-monitoring-integrations] in Cube
Cloud.

### Exporting logs

To export logs to Amazon S3, start by creating an S3 bucket for Cube Cloud logs.

Then, configure the [`aws_s3`](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/aws_s3/)
sink in your [`vector.toml` configuration file][ref-monitoring-integrations-conf].

Example configuration:

```toml
[sinks.aws_s3]
type = "aws_s3"
inputs = [
  "cubejs-server",
  "refresh-scheduler",
  "ext-db",
  "warmup-job",
  "cubestore"
]
bucket = "your-s3-bucket-name"
region = "us-east-1"
compression = "gzip"

[sinks.aws_s3.auth]
access_key_id = "$CUBE_CLOUD_MONITORING_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
secret_access_key = "$CUBE_CLOUD_MONITORING_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"

[sinks.aws_s3.encoding]
codec = "json"

[sinks.aws_s3.healthcheck]
enabled = false
```

Commit the configuration for Vector, it should take effect in a minute. Then,
navigate to your S3 bucket and watch the logs coming.

## Troubleshooting

### Bucket region mismatch

You might see the following error message in Vector logs:

```
The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified
endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint.
```

This often happens if the bucket on Amazon S3 is in a region that is different
from the one you’ve specified in the configuration for Vector.
