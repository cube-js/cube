# Integration with Amazon CloudWatch

[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) is an application
monitoring service that collects and visualizes logs, metrics, and event data.
This guide demonstrates how to set up Cube Cloud to export logs to Amazon
CloudWatch.

## Configuration

First, enable [monitoring integrations][ref-monitoring-integrations] in Cube
Cloud.

### Exporting logs

To export logs to Amazon CloudWatch, start by creating [a log group and a log
stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html)
for Cube Cloud logs.

Then, configure the [`aws_cloudwatch_logs`](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/aws_cloudwatch_logs/)
sink in your [`vector.toml` configuration file][ref-monitoring-integrations-conf].

Example configuration:

```toml
[sinks.aws_cloudwatch_logs]
type = "aws_cloudwatch_logs"
inputs = [
  "cubejs-server",
  "refresh-scheduler",
  "warmup-job",
  "cubestore"
]
region = "us-east-1"
group_name = "your-group-name"
stream_name = "your-stream-name"
create_missing_group = true
create_missing_stream = true

[sinks.aws_cloudwatch_logs.auth]
access_key_id = "$CUBE_CLOUD_MONITORING_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
secret_access_key = "$CUBE_CLOUD_MONITORING_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"

[sinks.aws_cloudwatch_logs.encoding]
codec = "json"
```

Commit the configuration for Vector, it should take effect in a minute. Then,
navigate to Amazon CloudWatch and watch the logs coming.
