# Visual Modeler

With Cube Visual Modeler, non-technical users can actively participate in data
modeling without writing a single line of code, and code-proficient engineers 
have the option of working in code or no-code.

<SuccessBox>

Visual Modeler is available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier.
[Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact) for details.

## Using Visual Modeler

Cube Visual Modeler lets you see and edit your Cube data model in an easy-to-use,
graphical interface. You can also switch seamlessly between Visual Modeler and 
the original code-based [Data Model editor][ref-data-model] depending on your needs.

To open Visual Modeler, click on the "Show Canvas" in the top right of the Data Model
page. Visual Modeler will stay open until you go back to the code editor by clicking
the "View Code" button or "Show Code" on any cube or view node.

## Cubes

### Adding cubes

To add a cube, click the "Add Cube" button in the top left of the Visual Modeler
screen. This brings up the Add Cube dialog where you can select a table from your
database, choose dimensions and primary keys, and review your choices before 
submitting.

<InfoBox>
  Note that you cannot add measures at this step. To do so, first add your cube,
  then follow the instructions in [Editing cubes](#editing-cubes) or [Adding 
  dimensions and measures](#adding-dimensions-and-measures) below.

### Editing cubes

To edit a cube, first select the cube on the canvas by clicking on it. Then, in
the sidebar, click "Edit" in the top right. This brings up a modal where you can
edit the cube's details (name, title, SQL, etc.), dimensions, measures, and 
relationships.

You may use this dialog to add dimensions, measures, and joins, or do so via the
[Adding dimensions and measures](#adding-dimensions-and-measures) and [Working
with joins](#working-with-joins) sections below.

### Adding dimensions and measures

To add a dimension or measure, first select a cube on the canvas by clicking on
it. Them, in the sidebar, click "Add Dimension" or "Add Measure."

### Working with joins

You can add or edit joins via the "Relationships" section of the Edit Cube dialog
(see "[Editing cubes](#editing-cubes)" above).

Visual Modeler also lets you add joins visually by dragging a line on the canvas
from the side of one dimension to another.

## Views

### Adding views
To add a view, click the "Views" tab at the top of the canvas. Then, click "Add
View". This brings up a dialog where you can choose the base cube, set the view
details such as name and title, and add joins and join paths.

### Editing views

The same dialog may be used to edit existing views by selecting the view in the 
dropdown, clicking on it in the canvas, and clicking "Edit" in the sidebar.

## YAML mode

All the dialogs mentioned above have a "YAML mode" where you can see and edit
the Cube YAML generated by Visual Modeler. This lets you add properties that
are not natively supported by the Visual Modeler GUI (for example [meta 
tags][ref-meta]) or inspect the YAML you've generated before submitting it.

To access YAML mode, click the "Create with YAML" or "Edit with YAML" button
at the bottom of the dialog.

## Limitations

Cube Visual Modeler does not natively support some features of the Cube data
model when adding or editing cubes and views. However, these may be added via
[YAML mode](#yaml-mode) or in the [data model code editor][ref-data-model].

For example, the following are not included in Visual Modeler:
- [Meta tags][ref-meta]
- [Segments][ref-segments]
- [Refresh keys][ref-refresh-keys], [pre-aggregations][ref-pre-aggregations], [subqueries][ref-sub-query], or [granularities][ref-granularities] on dimensions
- [Drill members][ref-drill-members] or [rolling windows][ref-rolling-window] on measures

Cubes and views using those features will still be displayed in
Visual Modeler, but those fields can only be edited via [YAML mode](#yaml-mode)
or in the code editor.

Additionally, Visual Modeler only allows editing of cubes and views that are
defined in YAML, not JavaScript, and it does not allow editing of [dynamic data
models][ref-dynamic-data-models] or models which use [Jinja][ref-jinja], although
they will still be displayed on the canvas.
