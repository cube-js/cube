# Deployments in Cube Cloud

Deployments are top-level entities in Cube Cloud. They include the source
code, configuration, allocated resources, API endpoints and essentially
do all the heavy lifting, running workloads and fulfilling requests.

## List of deployments

Each account in Cube Cloud can have multiple deployments. Once you've
logged in, you can access the list of deployments by clicking on
the&nbsp;<Btn>Cube Cloud</Btn> logo in the top left corner.

## Deployment overview

The&nbsp;<Btn>Overview</Btn> page of each deployment provides a high-level
summary if its components and state:
* API endpoints with URLs and connection instructions.
* Allocated resources in line with the [deployment type][ref-deployment-types].
* Activity log of the most recent events.

Additionally, the bar under the&nbsp;<Btn>Cube Cloud</Btn> logo displays
user-specific state of the deployment:
* Branch selector displays the source code branch that is currently
  selected and being viewed by the user.
* <Btn>Enter Development Mode</Btn> button indicates whether a user has
  entered the [development mode][ref-dev-mode].

## Resource consumption

Each deployment allocates and consumes the following resources:

* For the main branch of the source code, a set of resources in line with
  the [deployment type][ref-deployment-types].
* For any other branch of the source code, a [development
  instance][ref-dev-instance].
* For any user-specific [development mode][ref-dev-mode] branch, a
  [development instance][ref-dev-instance].
* If pre-aggregations are used, a minimum of two Cube Store workers.

Cube Cloud only consumes resources when they are needed to run workloads:

* For the main branch, resources are always consumed unless a deployment is
  [auto-suspended][ref-auto-sus].
* For any other branch or any user-specific development mode branch,
  a development instance is allocated while there's some activity in the
  branch, e.g., API endpoints are serving requests, a user is active in
  Cube Cloud, etc. After a period of inactivity, the development instance
  is deallocated.
* For pre-aggregations, Cube Store workers are allocated while there's some
  activity related to pre-aggregations, e.g., API endpoints are serving
  requests to pre-aggregations, pre-aggregations are being built, etc.
  After a period of inactivity, Cube Store workers are deallocated.

resource consumption in different scenarios.
