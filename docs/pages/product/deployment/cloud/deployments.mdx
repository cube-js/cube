# Deployments in Cube Cloud

Deployments are top-level entities in Cube Cloud. They include the source
code, configuration, allocated resources, API endpoints and essentially
do all the heavy lifting, running workloads and fulfilling requests.

## List of deployments

Each account in Cube Cloud can have multiple deployments. Once you've
logged in, you can access the list of deployments by clicking on
the&nbsp;<Btn>Cube Cloud</Btn> logo in the top left corner.

## Creating a new deployment

Creating a new deployment is an essential prerequisite to running a Cube
project in Cube Cloud.

After you've created your [Cube Cloud account][cube-cloud-signup],
click&nbsp;<Btn>+ Create Deployment</Btn> in the top-right corner of your
list of deployments to jump into the wizard. Watch the following video for
guidance on the rest of the steps:

<YouTubeVideo url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVZ4ytDEjqc" />

All deployments within a Cube Cloud account should have uniqie names.

## Demo deployments

After you've created your [Cube Cloud account][cube-cloud-signup] and
proceeded to create a new deployment, you would be prompted to set up a
connection to your [data source][ref-data-source].

If, for any reason, you're not ready or unable to connect your staging or
production data source at the moment, you can click&nbsp;<Btn>Create a demo
deployment</Btn> in the yellow box:

Shortly, Cube Cloud will create and pre-configure a new deployment in your
account. You will see it as&nbsp;<Btn>Demo deployment</Btn> in the list of
deployments. This new deployment will be:

- Configured to use [DuckDB][ref-duckdb] as the data source.
- Provided with a sample [data model][ref-data-model] backed with CSV files
in a public S3 bucket.
- Provided with an example of [dynamic data modeling][ref-dynamic-data-models]
and programmatic [configuration options][ref-config-options].

Watch the following video to for a step-by-step walkthrough:

Exploring the demo deployment is a great way to understand how Cube works.
Use the [data model editor][ref-data-model] to review the data model and
make sure to run a few queries in [Playground][ref-playground].

## Deployment overview

The&nbsp;<Btn>Overview</Btn> page of each deployment provides a high-level
summary if its components and state:
* API endpoints with URLs and connection instructions.
* Allocated resources in line with the [deployment type][ref-deployment-types].
* Activity log of the most recent events.

Additionally, the bar under the&nbsp;<Btn>Cube Cloud</Btn> logo displays
user-specific state of the deployment:
* Branch selector displays the source code branch that is currently
  selected and being viewed by the user.
* <Btn>Enter Development Mode</Btn> button indicates whether a user has
  entered the [development mode][ref-dev-mode].

## Cube version

Each [environment][ref-environments] within a Cube Cloud deployment runs a specific
version of Cube that depends on the environment type and the selected [update
channel](#update-channels).

### Current version

You can check the current version of Cube that your deployment (environment) runs by
navigating to <Btn>Overview → Resources & Logs → Cube API</Btn>:

/>

### Update channels

Cube Cloud provides two update channels:

* **Stable channel.** You should manually update the deployment to one of
available stable versions.
* **Latest channel.** On each build, the deployment is automatically updated
to the most up-to-date version of Cube.

You can view or change the update channel by navigating to <Btn>Settings →
General → Cube version</Btn>:

## Resource consumption

Cube Cloud deployments only consume resources when they are needed to run workloads:

* For the [production environment][ref-environments-prod], resources are always consumed
unless a deployment is [suspended][ref-auto-sus].
* For any other [environment][ref-environments], a development instance is allocated
while it's active. After a period of inactivity, the development instance is deallocated.
* For pre-aggregations, Cube Store workers are allocated while there's some
  activity related to pre-aggregations, e.g., API endpoints are serving
  requests to pre-aggregations, pre-aggregations are being built, etc.
  After a period of inactivity, Cube Store workers are deallocated.

Please refer to [total cost examples][ref-total-cost] to learn more about
resource consumption in different scenarios.
