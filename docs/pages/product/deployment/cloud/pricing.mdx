# Pricing in Cube Cloud

Cube Cloud pricing is based on consumption of compute power which we measure
using [Cube Compute Units](#cube-compute-unit) in 5 minute intervals. Each [pricing
plan](#pricing-plans) has different features and functionality that you should review
as you think about what is right for your business.

## Cube Compute Unit

A **Cube Compute Unit** (CCU) is a way to measure compute power used to run Cube Cloud
infrastructure and resources within it. 

| Resource type             | CCUs per hour (measured in 5 minute intervals) |
| ------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------: |
| Production Cluster        |                       4                        |
| Development Instance      |                       1                        |
| Cube Store Worker         |                       1                        |
| Cube API Instance         |                       1                        |

The price of a CCU is determined by the pricing plan you're subscribed to.

Each plan determines the features, scalability, availability, as well as the [speed and
scope of support][ref-support] you may receive for your deployment.

During your deployment, Premium, Enterprise, and Enterprise Premier customers can set
[Budgets][ref-cloud-budgets] to make sure you know your usage is on track and as expected.

## Total cost examples

The following examples provide insight into the total cost to use Cube Cloud.

### Small-scale deployment

Suppose a company uses Cube Cloud to power self-serve business intelligence for
a couple of teams in Eastern and Pacific time zones.

This organization:
* Uses the Premium plan of Cube Cloud.
* Runs a single Production Cluster that is active 24/7 but never has to auto-scale
its API instances because the usage is spread evenly with no bursts.
* Operates on a small volume of data that requires the usage of just 2 Cube Store
Workers to run queries and refresh pre-aggregations mostly during working hours,
being active approximately 50% of the time.
* Updates its data model infrequently and without using a dedicated Development
Instance for testing purposes, with 2 data engineers spending just 1 hour a day each,
in the development mode of the Production Cluster.

### Medium-scale deployment

Suppose a company with globally distributed workforce uses Cube Cloud to enable self-serve
exploration in multiple BI tools and AI agents; it also uses Cube Cloud to power embedded
analytics in its SaaS platform that caters to a vast worldwide customer base. 

This organization:
* Uses the Enterprise plan of Cube Cloud.
* Runs two Production Clusters that are active 24/7 and auto-scale up to 8 API instances
during a peak hour every day.
* Operates on a moderate volume of data that requires the usage of 4 Cube Store
Workers by both Production Clusters to run queries and refresh pre-aggregations 24/7,
being active approximately 50% of the time.
* Uses a dedicated Development Instance for testing purposes that is active 12 hours a day.
* Has a team of 5 data engineers who frequently update the data model, with each data engineer
spending about 4 hours a day in the development mode of the dedicated Development Instance.

## Overages and payment terms

### Overages

If your usage of resources exceeds the balance of CCUs in your account, the CCU
price will revert from the Annual Commit Price (available on the [pricing
page][cube-pricing]) to the Standard Retail Price shown below:

| Subscription Plan  | CCU Price (Standard Retail Price) |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Premium            | 0.45                              |
| Enterprise         | 0.60                              |
| Enterprise Premier | 0.90                              |

Cube Cloud will show a message similar to the following one:

<Screenshot src="https://ucarecdn.com/7f23d7be-f22d-46c4-b704-1c0be4a74d06/" />

### Upgrades

You may upgrade your CCUs to a higher-level subscription plan at any time by
paying the difference in per-Cube Compute Unit pricing, or by asking to convert
the price paid for the remaining CCUs into CCUs for the higher subscription plan
at the CCU pricing for that plan (resulting in a lower number of available CCUs
but upgraded to the higher subscription plan).

### Terms

If payment is not received within the contract terms (usually Net-30) or for
additional required payment for CCUs exceeding the balance of CCUs in your
account, services may degrade or be suspended until new CCUs are purchased.

Future purchases and upgrades are subject to the pricing that is in effect at
the time of the order. No credit is allowed for downgrading CCUs to a lower
subscription plan level. Payments are non-refundable.
