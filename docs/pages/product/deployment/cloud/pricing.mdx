# Pricing in Cube Cloud

Cube Cloud pricing is based on consumption of compute power which we measure
using [Cube Compute Units](#cube-compute-unit) in 5 minute intervals. Each [pricing
plan](#pricing-plans) has different features and functionality that you should review
as you think about what is right for your business.

## Cube Compute Unit

A **Cube Compute Unit** (CCU) is a way to measure compute power used to run Cube Cloud
infrastructure and resources within it. 

| Resource type             | CCUs per hour (measured in 5 minute intervals) |
| ------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------: |
| Production Cluster        |                       4                        |
| Development Instance      |                       1                        |
| Cube Store Worker         |                       1                        |
| Cube API Instance         |                       1                        |

The price of a CCU is determined by the pricing plan you're subscribed to.

Each plan determines the features, scalability, availability, as well as the [speed and
scope of support][ref-support] you may receive for your deployment.

During your deployment, Premium, Enterprise, and Enterprise Premier customers can set
[Budgets][ref-cloud-budgets] to make sure you know your usage is on track and as expected.

## Overages and payment terms

### Overages

If your usage of resources exceeds the balance of CCUs in your account, the CCU
price will revert from the Annual Commit Price (available on the pricing page
here) to the Standard Retail Price shown below:

| Subscription Plan  | CCU Price (Standard Retail Price) |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Premium            | 0.45                              |
| Enterprise         | 0.60                              |
| Enterprise Premier | 0.90                              |

### Upgrades

You may upgrade your CCUs to a higher-level subscription plan at any time by
paying the difference in per-Cube Compute Unit pricing, or by asking to convert
the price paid for the remaining CCUs into CCUs for the higher subscription plan
at the CCU pricing for that plan (resulting in a lower number of available CCUs
but upgraded to the higher subscription plan).

### Terms

If payment is not received within the contract terms (usually Net-30) or for
additional required payment for CCUs exceeding the balance of CCUs in your
account, services may degrade or be suspended until new CCUs are purchased.

Future purchases and upgrades are subject to the pricing that is in effect at
the time of the order. No credit is allowed for downgrading CCUs to a lower
subscription plan level. Payments are non-refundable.
