# Pricing in Cube Cloud

Cube Cloud pricing is based on resource consumption which we measure
using [Cube Consumption Units](#cube-consumption-unit) in 5 minute intervals.
Each [product tier](#product-tiers) has different features and functionality
that you should review as you think about what is right for your business.

## Cube Consumption Unit

_Cube Consumption Unit_ (CCU) is a way to measure resource consumption
used to run Cube Cloud infrastructure and [resources](#resources) within it. 

The price of a CCU is determined by the [product tier](#product-tiers) you're subscribed to.
Each product tier determines the features, scalability, availability, as well as
the [speed and scope of support][ref-support] you may receive for your deployment.

You can also set [Budgets][ref-cloud-budgets] to make sure you know your usage
is on track and as expected.

## Payment plans

Payment plans determine whether you have a fixed-term contract or a recurring
subscription:

* _On-demand payment plan_ allows you to subscribe at any time, add your credit
card, and start using Cube Cloud right away. [Starter](#starter) and [Premium](#premium)
product tiers are available on the on-demand payment plan.
* _Commit payment plan_ allows you to have a contract with a CCU amount specified
in an order form. [Premium](#premium), [Enterprise](#enterprise), and
[Enterprise Premier](#enterprise-premier) product tiers are available on the
commit payment plan. [Contact us][link-contact-us] to learn more.

## Total cost examples

The following examples provide insight into the total cost to use Cube Cloud:
- [Small-scale deployment](#small-scale-deployment) (production cluster, Premium product tier).
- [Medium-scale deployment](#medium-scale-deployment) (production cluster with auto-scaling, Enterprise product tier).
- [Large-scale deployment](#large-scale-deployment) (production multi-cluster
with dedicated infrastructure, Enterprise product tier).

### Small-scale deployment

Suppose a company uses Cube Cloud to power self-serve business intelligence for
a couple of teams in Eastern and Pacific time zones.

This organization:
* Uses the Premium product tier of Cube Cloud.
* Runs a single Production Cluster that is active 24/7 but never has to auto-scale
its API instances because the usage is spread evenly with no bursts.
* Operates on a small volume of data that requires the usage of just 2 Cube Store
Workers to run queries and refresh pre-aggregations mostly during working hours,
being active approximately 50% of the time.
* Updates its data model infrequently and without using a dedicated Development
Instance for testing purposes, with 2 data engineers spending just 1 hour a day each,
in the development mode of the Production Cluster.

| Resource                                        | Usage per month                                           | CCU per month                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Production Cluster                              | 1 Production Cluster ×<br/>24 hours per day ×<br/>30 days | 720 hours ×<br/>4 CCUs per hour =<br/>**2880 CCUs** |
| Additional Cube API Instance                    | —                                                         | —                                                   |
| Cube Store Worker                               | 2 Cube Store Workers ×<br/>12 hours per day ×<br/>30 days | 720 hours ×<br/>1 CCU per hour =<br/>**720 CCUs**   |
| Development Instance                            | —                                                         | —                                                   |
| Development Instance<br/>(for development mode) | 2 users ×<br/>1 hour per day ×<br/>30 days                | 60 hours ×<br/>1 CCU per hour =<br/>**60 CCUs**     |
| **Total**                                       |                                                           | **3660 CCUs**                                       |

### Medium-scale deployment

Suppose a company with a globally distributed workforce uses Cube Cloud to enable self-serve
exploration in multiple BI tools and AI agents; it also uses Cube Cloud to power embedded
analytics in its SaaS platform that caters to a vast worldwide customer base. 

This organization:
* Uses the Enterprise product tier of Cube Cloud.
* Runs two Production Clusters that are active 24/7 and auto-scale up to 8 API instances
during a peak hour every day.
* Operates on a moderate volume of data that requires the usage of 4 Cube Store
Workers by both Production Clusters to run queries and refresh pre-aggregations 24/7,
being active approximately 50% of the time.
* Uses a dedicated Development Instance for testing purposes that is active 12 hours a day.
* Has a team of 5 data engineers who frequently update the data model, with each data engineer
spending about 4 hours a day in the development mode of the dedicated Development Instance.

| **Total**                                       |                                                                                       | **9960 CCUs**                                        |

### Large-scale deployment

Suppose a company uses Cube Cloud as a mission-critical part of their infrastructure to enable
its globally distributed workforce, customer base, and (or) partners to operate at scale.

This organization:
* Uses the Enterprise product tier of Cube Cloud.
* Uses [dedicated infrastructure][ref-dedicated-infra].
* Runs a Production Multi-Cluster that is active 24/7, includes 3 Production Clusters, with each
Production Cluster auto-scaling up to 10 API instances during a few peak hours every day.
* Operates on a large volume of data that requires the usage of 16 Cube Store Workers to run
queries and refresh pre-aggregations 24/7, being active approximately 50% of the time.
* Uses a dedicated Development Instance for testing purposes that is active 24 hours a day.
* Has a team of 10 data engineers who frequently update the data model, with each data engineer
spending about 4 hours a day in the development mode of the dedicated Development Instance.
* Uses a [Query History tier](#query-history-tiers) with 14-day data retention to inform the work
of data engineers.

## Payment terms

### Upgrades

You may upgrade your CCUs to a higher-level product tier at any time by
paying the difference in per-Cube Consumption Unit pricing, or by asking to convert
the price paid for the remaining CCUs into CCUs for the higher product tier
at the CCU pricing for that product tier (resulting in a lower number of available CCUs
but upgraded to the higher product tier).

### Terms

If payment is not received within the contract terms (usually Net-30) or for
additional required payment for CCUs exceeding the balance of CCUs in your
account, services may degrade or be suspended until new CCUs are purchased.

Future purchases and upgrades are subject to the pricing that is in effect at
the time of the order. No credit is allowed for downgrading CCUs to a lower
product tier level. Payments are non-refundable.
