# Limits and quotas in Cube Cloud

Cube Cloud implements limits on resource usage on account and deployment levels
to ensure the best experience for all Cube Cloud users.

<SuccessBox>

Limits apply to Cube Cloud accounts on [all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

## Limit types

Each limit can be of one of the following types:

- _Hard limit_ either has a threshold that can't be exceeded or prevents further
  use of a resource when a threshhold is hit until a cool-down period passes
  (e.g., until the next day starts) or the limit is increased (e.g., when a Cube
  Cloud account upgrades to another tier).
- _Soft limit_ may allow further use of a resource after a threshold is hit.

## Resources

The following resources are subject to limits, depending on [deployment
types][ref-deployment-types] and [pricing tiers][ref-pricing]:

| Resource                                                        | Free Tier |  Starter  |  Premium  | Enterprise |      Enterprise Premier       |

### Number of deployments

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Number of API instances

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Number of Cube Store workers

This is a hard limit. Consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Queries per day

This is a hard limit. Usage is calculated per Cube Cloud account, i.e., in total
for all deployments within an account.

When a threshold is hit, further queries will not be processed. In that case,
consider upgrading a development instance to a production cluster.
Alternatively, consider upgrading to [another tier][ref-pricing].

### Queries processed by Query History per day

This is a soft limit. Usage is calculated per Cube Cloud account, i.e., in total
for all deployments within an account.

When a threshold is hit, query processing will be stopped. Please [contact
support][cube-contact-us] for further assistance.

### Data retained by Query History

This is a soft limit. Usage is calculated per Cube Cloud account, i.e., in total
for all deployments within an account.

## Quotas

The [REST][ref-rest-api] and [GraphQL][ref-gql-api] APIs both have a standard
quota of 100 requests per second per deployment; this can also go higher
for short bursts of traffic. These limits can be raised on request,
[contact support][cube-contact-us] for more details.

When the quota is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests`
response.
