# Infrastructure Options

Cube Cloud provides four infrastructure options to host your Cube deployments:

* [Fully managed, shared infrastructure](#fully-managed-shared-infrastructure) - your
deployments are sharing compute resources and network with other customers.
Data in-motion and data at-rest are both on the Cube Cloud side.
* [Fully managed, dedicated infrastructure](#fully-managed-dedicated-infrastructure) - your
deployments reside in a dedicated VPC inside a Cube Cloud account and do not
share resources with anyone else. Data in-motion and data at-rest are both on
the Cube Cloud side.
* [Fully managed with CSPS](#customer-supplied-pre-aggregation-storage-csps) -
same as dedicated infrastructure, but data at-rest is stored in a user-provided
object store.
* [Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)](#byoc) - Cube Cloud data plane is fully hosted
in your cloud account.


## Fully managed, shared infrastructure

This is the most common deployment option that is the easiest to get started with.
In this scenario, everything is deployed on the Cube Cloud infrastructure in
one of our **Shared** VPCs. Cube Cloud Control Plane takes care of creating,
scaling, and monitoring your Cube Deployments, as well as managing Cube Store
and persisting pre-aggregated data. This option requires the least effort to
set up and is available on all pricing plans.

Please note that some Enterprise features, such as VPC peering or PrivateLink are
not available on the shared infrastructure. There's also a possibility of resource
contention, a.k.a. the "noisy neighbor" problem.

## Fully managed, dedicated infrastructure

It is similar to the previous option, but each customer gets a
[Dedicated][ref-dedicated-vpc] VPC within one of Cube Cloud's own cloud
accounts that hosts only that customer's deployments. This option is great for
most of the typical Enterprise use-cases as it provides a higher level of
performance, as well as additional security and isolation. It is is available on
the [Enterprise](https://cube.dev/pricing) plan and above.

## Customer Supplied Pre-Aggregation Storage (CSPS)

On the [Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) plan, Cube Cloud offers
an additional option that allows moving all data at rest to the customer
infrastructure. In this scenario, all Cube components reside on the Cube Cloud
side. However, Cube Store uses a customer-provided object store for reading and
persisting pre-aggregated data. This provides additional peace of mind when
processing highly critical business or personal information.

## BYOC

Bring Your Own Cloud, or BYOC, is the-highest tier deployment option designed to
meet strict compliance requirements. In the BYOC scenario, all Cube Cloud
components interacting with data are pushed over to the customer side while
still being managed by the Cube Cloud Control Plane. BYOC provides the highest
levels of security without sacrificing the power of management and development
tools provided by Cube Cloud. The BYOC option requires hands-on deployment
and is only available on the [Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) plan.
