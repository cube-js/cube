# Infrastructure Options

Cube Cloud provides four infrastructure options to host your Cube deployments:

* [Shared infrastructure](#shared-infrastructure) - your
deployments are sharing compute resources and network with other customers.
Data in-motion and data at-rest are both on the Cube Cloud side.
* [Dedicated infrastructure](#dedicated-infrastructure) - your
deployments reside in a dedicated VPC inside a Cube Cloud account and do not
share resources with anyone else. Data in-motion and data at-rest are both on
the Cube Cloud side.
* [Dedicated infrastructure with CSPS](#dedicated-infrastructure-with-csps) -
same as dedicated infrastructure, but data at-rest is stored in a customer-supplied
object store.
* [Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)](#byoc) - Cube Cloud data plane is fully hosted
in your cloud account.


## Shared infrastructure

This is the most common deployment option that is the easiest to get started with.
In this scenario, everything is deployed on the Cube Cloud infrastructure in
one of our **shared** VPCs. Cube Cloud Control Plane takes care of creating,
scaling, and monitoring your Cube Deployments, as well as managing Cube Store
and persisting pre-aggregated data. This option requires the least effort to
set up.

<SuccessBox>

Shared infrastructure is available in Cube Cloud on
[all plans](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

Please note that some Enterprise features, such as VPC peering or PrivateLink are
not available on the shared infrastructure. There's also a possibility of resource
contention ("noisy neighbor") problem.

## Dedicated infrastructure

It is similar to the previous option, but each customer gets a
[Dedicated][ref-dedicated-vpc] VPC within one of Cube Cloud's own cloud
accounts that hosts only that customer's deployments. This option is great for
most of the typical Enterprise use-cases as it provides a higher level of
performance, as well as additional security and isolation.

Dedicated infrastructure is available in Cube Cloud on
the [Enterprise](https://cube.dev/pricing) plan and above.

## Dedicated infrastructure with CSPS

Cube Cloud offers a **customer-supplied pre-aggregation storage (CSPS)** that
allows moving all data at rest to the customer
infrastructure. In this scenario, all Cube components reside on the Cube Cloud
side. However, Cube Store uses a customer-provided object store for reading and
persisting pre-aggregated data. This provides additional peace of mind when
processing highly critical business or personal information.

Dedicated infrastructure with CSPS is available in Cube Cloud on
the [Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) plan.

## BYOC

With [Bring Your Own Cloud](/product/deployment/cloud/byoc) (BYOC) all the components interacting with private data are deployed on the customer infrastructure 
on a platform of choice (AWS/Azure/GCP) and managed by the Cube Cloud Control Plane via the Cube Cloud Operator.

<SuccessBox>

BYOC is available in Cube Cloud on
the [Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) plan.
