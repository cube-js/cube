# Continuous deployment

This guide covers features and tools you can use to deploy your Cube project to
Cube Cloud.

## Deploy with Git

Continuous deployment works by connecting a Git repository to a Cube Cloud
deployment and keeping the two in sync.

First, go to the <Btn>Build & Deploy</Btn> tab on the <Btn>Settings</Btn> screen
to make sure your deployment is configured to deploy with Git. Then
click <Btn>Generate Git credentials</Btn> to obtain Git credentials:

The instructions to set up Cube Cloud as a Git remote are also available on the
same screen:

```bash{promptUser: user}
git config credential.helper store
git remote add cubecloud <YOUR-CUBE-CLOUD-GIT-URL>
git push cubecloud master
```

## Deploy with GitHub

First, ensure your deployment is configured to deploy with Git. Then connect
your GitHub repository to your deployment by clicking the <Btn>Connect to
GitHub</Btn> button, and selecting your repository.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/3dab6d90-6bd9-44a5-ae4d-d5579a08dd89/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

Cube Cloud will automatically deploy from the specified production branch
(`master` by default).

## Deploy with CLI

<WarningBox>

Enabling this option will cause the <Btn>Data Model</Btn> page to display the
last known state of a Git-based codebase (if available), instead of reflecting
the latest modifications made. It is important to note that the logic will still
be updated in both the API and the Playground.

</WarningBox>

You can use [the CLI][ref-workspace-cli] to set up continuous deployment for a
Git repository. You can also use it to manually deploy changes without
continuous deployment.

### Manual Deploys

You can deploy your Cube project manually. This method uploads data models and
configuration files directly from your local project directory.

You can obtain a Cube Cloud deploy token from your
deployment's <Btn>Settings</Btn> screen.

```bash{promptUser: user}
npx cubejs-cli deploy --token TOKEN
```

### Continuous Deployment

You can use Cube CLI with your continuous integration tool.

<InfoBox>

You can use the `CUBE_CLOUD_DEPLOY_AUTH` environment variable to pass the Cube
Cloud deploy token to Cube CLI.

</InfoBox>

Below is an example configuration for GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: My Cube App
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "**"
    branches:
      - "master"
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy My Cube App
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js 14.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14.x
      - name: Deploy to Cube Cloud
        run: npx cubejs-cli deploy
        env:
          CUBE_CLOUD_DEPLOY_AUTH: ${{ secrets.CUBE_CLOUD_DEPLOY_AUTH }}
```
