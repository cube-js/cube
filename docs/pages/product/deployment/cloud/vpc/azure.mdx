# Connecting with a VPC on Azure

## Prerequisites

To allow Cube Cloud to connect to a Virtual Network on Azure, the following
information is required:

- **Virtual Network Name:** This can be found in the Virtual Networks section of
  the [Azure Portal][azure-console].
- **Tenant ID:** This can be found under&nbsp;<Btn>Azure Active Directory</Btn>
  →&nbsp;<Btn>Properties</Btn> →&nbsp;<Btn>Tenant ID</Btn> in the [Azure Portal][azure-console].

## Setup

For cross-tenant peering in Azure, you are supposed to assign the peering role
to the service principal of the peering party.

Using the steps outlined below, you would register Cube Cloud tenant at your
organization and grant peering access to Cube Cloud service principal.

### Add Cube tenant to your organization

First you should add the Cube Cloud tenant to your organization. To do this,
open the [Azure Portal][azure-console] and go to&nbsp;<Btn>Azure Active
Directory</Btn> →&nbsp;<Btn>External Identities</Btn> →&nbsp;<Btn>Cross-tenant
access settings</Btn> →&nbsp;<Btn>Organizational Settings</Btn>
→&nbsp;<Btn>Add Organization</Btn>.

For Tenant ID, enter `197e5263-87f4-4ce1-96c4-351b0c0c714a`.

Make sure that&nbsp;<Btn>B2B Collaboration</Btn> →&nbsp;<Btn>Inbound Access</Btn>
→&nbsp;<Btn>Applications</Btn> is set to&nbsp;<Btn>Allows access</Btn>.

### Register Cube Cloud service principal at your organization

To register the Cube Cloud service principal for your organization, follow these
steps:

1.  Log in with an account that has permissions to register Enterprise
    applications.
2.  Open a browser tab and go to the following URL, replacing `<TENANT_ID>` with
    your tenant ID:
    `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/authorize?client_id=7f3afcf3-e061-4e1b-8261-f396646d7fc7&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2F`
3.  The Cube Cloud service principal has specific credentials. Check that the
    following details match exactly what you see on the dialog box that pops up:

- Client ID: `7f3afcf3-e061-4e1b-8261-f396646d7fc7`
- Name: `cube-dedicated-infra-peering-sp`

Once you have confirmed that all the information is correct,
select&nbsp;<Btn>Consent on behalf of your organization</Btn> and
click&nbsp;<Btn>Accept</Btn>.

### Grant peering permissions to Cube Cloud service principal on your `Virtual Network`

As `peering role` you can use built-in `Network Contributor` or create custom
role (e.g. `cube-peering-role`) with the following permissions:

- `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/write`
- `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/peer/action`
- `Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks/peer/action`
- `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/read`
- `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/delete`

On the [Azure Portal][azure-console], go to&nbsp;<Btn>Virtual networks</Btn>
→ _Virtual Network Name_ →&nbsp;<Btn>Access Control (IAM)</Btn>
→&nbsp;<Btn>Add</Btn> →&nbsp;<Btn>Add role assignment</Btn> and fill
in the following details:

- Role: `Network Contributor` or `cube-peering-role`
- Members: `cube-dedicated-infra-peering-sp`

### Firewall

Make sure that your firewall rules allow inbound and outbound traffic to IP/port
your database is listening at.
