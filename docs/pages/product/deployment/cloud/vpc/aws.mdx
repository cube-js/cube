# Connecting with a VPC on AWS

[Dedicated infrastructure][dedicated-infrastructure] in Cube Cloud comes with
an option of setting up a direct network connection between
an AWS VPC on the Cube Cloud side and your own VPC(s). Such a connection allows you to
access internal datasources without the need to expose any ports publicly.

On AWS, Cube Cloud supports two main ways of establishing a private network connection:

- [AWS PrivateLink][aws-private-link]
- [VPC Peering][aws-vpc-peering]

[dedicated-infrastructure]: /product/deployment/cloud/infrastructure#dedicated-infrastructure
[aws-private-link]: /product/deployment/cloud/vpc/aws/private-link
[aws-vpc-peering]: /product/deployment/cloud/vpc/aws/vpc-peering
