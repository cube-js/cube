# Bring Your Own Cloud

This guide outlines the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployment configuration for Cube Cloud. 
With BYOC, all the components interacting with private data are deployed on the customer infrastructure 
on a platform of choice (AWS/Azure/GCP) and managed by the Cube Cloud Control Plane via the Cube Cloud Operator.
