# Auto-suspension

<SuccessBox>

Auto-suspension is available in Cube Cloud on
[Starter and above tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</SuccessBox>

Cube Cloud can automatically suspend deployments when not in use to reduce
[resource consumption][ref-deployment-pricing], which helps manage your spend.

<WarningBox>

Auto-suspension is useful for deployments that are not used 24/7, such as
staging deployments. However, **auto-suspension shall not be used for production
deployments**. See [effects on experience][self-effects] for details.

</WarningBox>

Auto-suspension will hibernate the deployment when **no** API
requests are received after a period of time, and automatically resume the
deployment when API requests start coming in again:

[Development Instances][ref-deployment-dev-instance] are auto-suspended
automatically when not in use for 10 minutes, whereas [Production
Clusters][ref-deployment-prod-cluster] and [Production
Multi-Clusters][ref-deployment-prod-multi-cluster] can auto-suspend after no API
requests were received within a configurable time period. While suspended,
[pre-aggregation][ref-caching-preaggs-gs] builds will also be paused to prevent
unnecessary resource consumption.

During auto-suspension, resources are monitored in 5 minute intervals. This
means that if a deployment was suspended 4 minutes ago, and a request comes in,
the deployment will resume immediately and 5 minute of CCU usage will be billed.

## Effects on experience

If auto-suspension is enabled, the behavior of your Cube Cloud deployment will
experience some notable changes.

When a deployment is auto-suspended:

- [Data model][ref-data-model] compilation artifacts are discarded since the
API instances are de-provisioned.
- [Refresh worker][ref-refresh-worker] is suspended, which prevents
the pre-aggregations from being kept up-to-date.
- [Monitoring integrations][ref-monitoring] are also suspended, which prevents
the export of metrics and logs.

When a deployment is resumed from auto-suspension:

- [Data model][ref-data-model] compilation would need to be done from scratch.
It applies to all tenants in case [multitenancy][ref-multitenancy] is set up.
Consequently, one or more queries served after a deployment is resumed from
auto-suspension are likely to have suboptimal performance.
- [Refresh worker][ref-refresh-worker] would need to refresh all
pre-aggregations that became stale during the suspension, competing for the
query queue with API instances and compromising the end-user experience.

## Configuration

To configure auto-suspension settings, navigate to the <Btn>Settings</Btn>
screen in your deployment and click the <Btn>Configuration</Btn> tab, then
ensure <Btn>Enable Auto-suspend</Btn> is turned on:

/>

To configure how long Cube Cloud should wait before suspending the deployment,
adjust <Btn>Auto-suspend threshold (minutes)</Btn> to the desired value and
click <Btn>Apply</Btn>:

/>

The Cube API instances will temporarily become unavailable while they are
configured; this usually takes less than a minute.

## Resuming a suspended deployment

To resume a suspended deployment, send a query to Cube using the API or by
navigating to the deployment in Cube Cloud.

<WarningBox>

Currently, Cube Cloud's auto-suspension feature cannot guarantee a 100% resume
rate on the first query or a specific time frame for resume. While in most
cases, deployment resumes within several seconds of the first query, there is
still a possibility that it may take longer to resume your deployment. This can
potentially lead to an error response code for the initial query.

</WarningBox>

Deployments typically resume in under 30 seconds, but can take significantly
longer in certain situations depending on two major factors:

- **Data model:** How many cubes and views are defined.
- **Query complexity:** How complicated the queries being sent to the API are

Complex data models take more time to compile, and complex queries can cause
response times to be significantly longer than usual.
