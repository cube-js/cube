# Deployment types

## Development Instance

<SuccessBox>

Development instance is available in Cube Cloud for free, no credit card
required. Your free trial is limited to 2 development instances and only 1,000
queries per day. Upgrade to [any tier](https://cube.dev/pricing) to unlock all
features.

</div>

Development Instances are designed for development use-cases only. This makes it
easy to get started with Cube Cloud quickly, and also allows you to build and
query pre-aggregations on-demand.

Development Instances do not provide high-availability nor do they guarantee
fast response times. Development Instances also hibernate after 10 minutes of
inactivity, which can cause the first request after hibernation to take
additional time to process. They also have [limits][ref-limits] on the maximum
number of queries per day and the maximum number of Cube Store Workers. We
**strongly** advise not using a development instance in a production
environment, it is for testing and learning about Cube only and will not deliver
a production-level experience for your users.

You can try a Cube Cloud development instance by
[signing up for Cube Cloud](https://cubecloud.dev/auth/signup) to try it free
(no credit card required).

## Production Cluster

<SuccessBox>

Production cluster is available in Cube Cloud on
[all tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing).

</div>

Production Clusters are designed to support high-availability production
workloads. It consists of several key components, including starting with 2 Cube
API instances, 1 Cube Refresh Worker and 2 Cube Store Routers - all of which run
on dedicated infrastructure. The cluster can automatically scale to meet the
needs of your workload by adding more components as necessary; check the page on
[scalability][ref-scalability] to learn more.

## Production multi-cluster

You can deploy a production multi-cluster in Cube Cloud, which allows for larger
amounts of data as well as load balancing for multi-tenant deployments with over
1,000 tenants.

<SuccessBox>

Production multi-cluster is available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) tier.
[Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact) for details.

</div>

Cube Cloud routes traffic between clusters based on
[`contextToAppId()`][ref-conf-ref-ctx-to-app-id].

Each cluster is billed separately, and all clusters can use auto-scaling to
match demand.
