## Support hours

Official support hours are weekdays (Monday through Friday) from 8am ET to 8pm
ET. The above response times are only during support hours.

## Support priority definitions

We prioritize support requests based on their severity, as follows:

- **P0**: The platform is severely impacted or completely shut down. We will
  assign specialists to work continuously to fix the issue, provide ongoing
  updates, and start working on a temporary workaround or fix.

- **P1**: The platform is functioning with limited capabilities or facing
  critical issues preventing a production deployment. We will assign specialists
  to fix the issue, provide ongoing updates, and start working on a temporary
  workaround or fix.

- **P2**: There are issues with workaround solutions or non-critical functions.
  We will use resources during local business hours until the issue is resolved
  or a workaround is in place.

- **P3**: There is a need for clarification in the documentation, or a
  suggestion for product enhancement. We will triage the request, provide
  clarification when possible, and may include a resolution in a future update.
