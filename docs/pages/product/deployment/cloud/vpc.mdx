# Connecting with a VPC in Cube Cloud

For improved stability and security, Cube Cloud supports connecting to one or
more VPCs (virtual private clouds) in your Azure, AWS, or GCP accounts.

<SuccessBox>

VPC connectivity requires [dedicated infrastructure][ref-dedicated-infra]
and is available in Cube Cloud on
[Enterprise and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.

</SuccessBox>

VPC connection improves stability through dedicated infrastructure for a
deployment and improves security by preventing your database traffic from being
routed through the public internet.
