# Deploying Cube to Cube Cloud

This page explains the basics of deploying Cube to [Cube Cloud][link-cube-cloud],
a purpose-built fully-managed platform to run Cube applications in production. It is made
and supported by the creators of Cube and incorporates all the best
practices of running and scaling Cube applications.

In Cube Cloud, you can:

* [Create an account](https://cubecloud.dev/auth/signup).
* Invite one or more users to the account, [assign roles][ref-rbac] to them,
  and enable [single sign-on][ref-sso].
* Use a supported [cloud provider][ref-providers] and, optionally, connect with a [dedicated VPC][ref-vpc].
* Create one or more [deployments][ref-deployments] of [various
  types][ref-deployment-types], and set up [continuous deployment][ref-cd].
* Within each deployment, allocate resources, run Cube, and use a set of
  API endpoints for the source code in the main branch, any other branch,
  or any user-specific [development mode][ref-dev-mode] branch.
* Assign a [custom domain][ref-domains] to API endpoints of any deployment.
* Review [performance insights][ref-performance], use the [deployment warm-up][ref-warmup],
and fine-tune deployments for better [scalability][ref-scalability].
* Set up account-wide [budgets][ref-budgets] to control resource consumption
  and use [auto-suspension][ref-auto-sus] to reduce resource consumption of
  non-production deployments.
