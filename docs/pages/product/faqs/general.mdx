## Can I try Cube Cloud for free?

Yes. Cube Cloud provides free
[development instances](/product/deployment/cloud/deployment-types#development-instance)
and a set of [paid tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing). Each tier comes with
additional features, however, you're welcome to use development instances
indefinitely if they satisfy your needs.
