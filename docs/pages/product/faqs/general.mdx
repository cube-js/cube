## Is there a row limit on the results of a query?

The row limit for all query results is set to 10,000 rows by default. You may
specify a row limit up to 50,000 in query parameters for an individual query. If
more rows are needed, we recommend using pagination in your application to
request more rows.

## Can I try Cube Cloud for free?

Yes. Cube Cloud provides free
[development instances](/product/deployment/cloud/deployment-types#development-instance)
and a set of [paid tiers](https://cube.dev/pricing). Each tier comes with
additional features, however, you're welcome to use development instances
indefinitely if they satisfy your needs.
