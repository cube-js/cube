# Connecting with a VPC on GCP

Work with your Cube sales or customer success team to initiate this process.

- [Sign up for a Cube Cloud account][cube-cloud-signup] if you haven't already.
- Let the Cube team know your Cube Cloud tenant name (e.g. example.cubecloud.dev) and your desired GCP region for the deployment.  For best performance, select one of the "Supported Regions" listed below.
- Cube will provision the VPC and provide the following information you can use to create the peering request:
  - [Google Cloud Project ID][gcp-docs-projects]
  - Google Cloud VPC Network Name

## Setup

### VPC Peering

After receiving the information above, create a [VPC peering
request][gcp-docs-vpc-peering], either through the [GCP Web
Console][gcp-console] or an infrastructure-as-code tool. To send a VPC peering
request through the Google Cloud Console, follow [the instructions
here][gcp-docs-create-vpc-peering], with the following amendments:

- In Step 6, use the project name `XXXXX`, and the project ID and network name(s) provided by Cube.
- In Step 7, ensure **Import custom routes** and **Export custom routes** are
  selected so that the necessary routes are created.

## Supported Regions

- `northeast1`
- `europe-west-2`
- `europe-west-3`
- `us-central-1`

## Notes

### Cloud SQL

Google Cloud SQL databases [can only be peered to a VPC within the same GCP
project][gcp-docs-vpc-peering-restrictions]. To work around this limitation, we
recommend that customers provision a micro VM in their Google Cloud account to
run the [Cloud SQL Auth Proxy][gcp-cloudsql-auth-proxy].
