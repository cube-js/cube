# Jupyter

Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating and sharing computational
documents.

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Jupyter to Cube.

<LoomVideo url="https://www.loom.com/embed/bdb42d1c9e5a4bb8991d11e1ecab8324" />

## Connect from Cube Cloud

Navigate to the [Integrations](/product/workspace/integrations#connect-specific-tools)
page, click <Btn>Connect to Cube</Btn>, and choose <Btn>Jupyter</Btn> to get
detailed instructions.

## Connect from Cube Core

You can connect a Cube deployment to Jupyter using the [SQL API][ref-sql-api].

In Cube Core, the SQL API is disabled by default. Enable it and [configure
the credentials](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api#configuration) to
connect to Jupyter.

## Connecting from Jupyter

Jupyter connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

### Creating a connection

Make sure to install the `sqlalchemy` and `pandas` modules.

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pandas
```

Then you can use `sqlalchemy.create_engine` to connect to Cube's SQL API.

```python
import sqlalchemy
import pandas

engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(
    sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL(
        drivername="postgresql",
        username="cube",
        password="9943f670fd019692f58d66b64e375213",
        host="thirsty-raccoon.sql.aws-eu-central-1.cubecloudapp.dev",
        port="5432",
        database="db@thirsty-raccoon",
    ),
    echo_pool=True,
)
print("connecting with engine " + str(engine))
connection = engine.connect()

# ...
```

### Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

You can write SQL in Jupyter that will be executed in Cube. Learn more about
Cube SQL syntax on the [reference page][ref-sql-api].

```python
# ...

query = "SELECT SUM(count), status FROM orders GROUP BY status;"
df = pandas.read_sql_query(query, connection)
```

In your Jupyter notebook it'll look like this.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/616046d9-729f-426e-8000-d15c6ca90347/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

You can also create a visualization of the executed SQL query.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://ucarecdn.com/91f558c2-f65c-43cf-9747-3423c3894330/"
    style={{ border: "none" }}
    width="100%"
  />
</div>
