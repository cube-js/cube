## SQL API

You can use the [SQL API][ref-sql-api] to connect Cube to Explo.

### Cube Cloud

On the&nbsp;<Btn>Overview</Btn> page of your Cube Cloud deployment,
click&nbsp;<Btn>Connect to SQL API</Btn> and select&nbsp;<Btn>Explo</Btn>
from the list. You should see the screen like the one below with
your connection credentials:

### Self-hosted Cube

In Cube Core, the SQL API is disabled by default. Enable it and [configure
the credentials](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api#configuration) to
connect to Explo.
