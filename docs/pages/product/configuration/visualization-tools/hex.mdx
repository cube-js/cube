# Hex

Hex is a collaborative, AI-powered workspace.

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Hex to Cube.

<LoomVideo url="https://www.loom.com/embed/8a35dfd4713947ddbfd4b7e0aa6142a1" />

## Connect from Cube Cloud

Navigate to the [Integrations](/product/workspace/integrations#connect-specific-tools)
page, click <Btn>Connect to Cube</Btn>, and choose <Btn>Hex</Btn> to get
detailed instructions.

## Connect from Cube Core

You can connect a Cube deployment to Hex using the [SQL API][ref-sql-api].

In Cube Core, the SQL API is disabled by default. Enable it and [configure
the credentials](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api#configuration) to
connect to Hex.

## Connecting from Hex

Hex connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

### Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

You can write SQL in Hex that will be executed in Cube. Learn more about Cube
SQL syntax on the [reference page][ref-sql-api].
