Deepnote is a data notebook that is built for collaboration and is Jupyter compatible.

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Deepnote to Cube.

## Connect from Cube Cloud

Navigate to the [Integrations](/product/workspace/integrations#connect-specific-tools)
page, click <Btn>Connect to Cube</Btn>, and choose <Btn>Deepnote</Btn> to get
detailed instructions.

## Connect from Cube Core

You can connect a Cube deployment to Deepnote using the [SQL API][ref-sql-api].

In Cube Core, the SQL API is disabled by default. Enable it and [configure
the credentials](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api#configuration) to
connect to Deepnote.

## Connecting from Deepnote

Deepnote connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

### Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

You can write SQL in Deepnote that will be executed in Cube. Learn more about
Cube SQL syntax on the [reference page][ref-sql-api].
