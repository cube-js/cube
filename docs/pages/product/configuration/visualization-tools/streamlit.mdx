# Streamlit

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.

Here's a short video guide on how to connect Streamlit to Cube.

<LoomVideo url="https://www.loom.com/embed/716b753ea8344e288160a6d8804d7bd6" />

## Connect from Cube Cloud

Navigate to the [Integrations](/product/workspace/integrations#connect-specific-tools)
page, click <Btn>Connect to Cube</Btn>, and choose <Btn>Streamlit</Btn> to get
detailed instructions.

## Connect from Cube Core

You can connect a Cube deployment to Streamlit using the [SQL API][ref-sql-api].

In Cube Core, the SQL API is disabled by default. Enable it and [configure
the credentials](/product/apis-integrations/sql-api#configuration) to
connect to Streamlit.

## Connecting from Streamlit

Streamlit connects to Cube as to a Postgres database.

### Creating a connection

Make sure to install the `streamlit`, `sqlalchemy` and `pandas` modules.

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pandas
```

Then you can use `sqlalchemy.create_engine` to connect to Cube's SQL API.

```python
import streamlit
import sqlalchemy
import pandas

engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(
  sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL(
    drivername="postgresql",
    username="cube",
    password="9943f670fd019692f58d66b64e375213",
    host="thirsty-raccoon.sql.aws-eu-central-1.cubecloudapp.dev",
    port="5432",
    database="db@thirsty-raccoon",
  ),
  echo_pool=True,
)
print("connecting with engine " + str(engine))
connection = engine.connect()

# ...
```

### Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.

You can write SQL in Streamlit that will be executed in Cube. Learn more about
Cube SQL syntax on the [reference page][ref-sql-api].

```python
# ...

with streamlit.echo():
  query = "SELECT sum(count) AS orders_count, status FROM orders GROUP BY status;"
df = pandas.read_sql_query(query, connection)
streamlit.dataframe(df)
```

In your Streamlit notebook it'll look like this. You can create a visualization
of the executed SQL query by using `streamlit.dataframe(df)`.
