# Retool

[Retool](https://retool.com/) is the fast way to build internal tools. It lets
you visually design apps that interface with any database or API.

### Create a POST request in Retool

Get your Cube query in the JSON
[query format](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api/query-format) ready. You can
copy it from Cubeâ€™s Playground or compose manually.

Create a POST request, paste the JSON query in the **Body**. Make sure to add a
`query` parameter for your JSON query.

Because the Cube REST API has the format of `HOST/cubejs-api/v1`, don't forget
to add the `/load` endpoint to the end of the data source API.

Next, hit Run.

### Display the data in Retool

Retool has an amazing feature where you can drag and drop UI components into the
dashboard. You can use this to add a tables, bar charts, and much more.

Because the name of the Retool query in the example is `OrdersByMonth`, using
the data binding curly brackets will populate the charts with data from the REST
API.

```handlebars
{{OrdersByMonth.data.data}}
```

Reference the name of the query in your Retool charts.
