# Power BI

[Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/power-platform/products/power-bi/)
is an interactive data visualization software product developed by Microsoft.

## Semantic Layer Sync

It is recommended to use [Semantic Layer Sync][ref-sls] to connect Cube to
Power BI. It automatically synchronizes the [data model][ref-data-model] between
Cube and Power BI.

## SQL API

You can also use the [SQL API][ref-sql-api] to connect Cube to Tableau.

### Cube Cloud

Click **How to connect your BI tool** link on the Overview page, navigate to the
SQL API tab and enable it. Once enabled, you should see the screen like the one
below with your connection credentials:

### Self-hosted Cube

You need to set the following environment variables to enable the Cube SQL API.
These credentials will be required to connect to Cube from PowerBI later.

```dotenv
CUBEJS_PG_SQL_PORT=5432
CUBEJS_SQL_USER=myusername
CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

## Connecting from Power BI

Power BI connects to Cube as to a Postgres database using the
[DirectQuery][link-powerbi-directquery] connectivity mode.

<InfoBox>

It's not recommended to import data into Power BI when connecting to Cube;
choose DirectQuery instead. Use [pre-aggregations][ref-pre-aggs] to improve
querying performance and manage data freshness upstream of Power BI.

</InfoBox>

## Querying data

Your cubes will be exposed as tables, where both your measures and dimensions
are columns.
