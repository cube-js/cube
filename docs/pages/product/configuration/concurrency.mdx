# Querying concurrency

All queries to [data APIs][ref-data-apis] are processed asynchronously via a _query
queue_. It allows to optimize the load and increase querying performance.

## Query queue

The query queue allows to deduplicate queries to API instances and insulate upstream
data sources from query spikes. It also allows to execute queries to data sources
concurrently for increased performance.

By default, Cube uses a _single_ query queue for queries from all API instances and
the refresh worker to all configured data sources.

You can read more about the query queue in the [this blog post](https://cube.dev/blog/how-you-win-by-using-cube-store-part-1#query-queue-in-cube).

### Multiple query queues

You can use the [`context_to_orchestrator_id`][ref-context-to-orchestrator-id]
configuration option to route queries to multiple queues based on the security
context.

<WarningBox>

If you're configuring multiple connections to data sources via the [`driver_factory`
configuration option][ref-driver-factory], you __must__ also configure
`context_to_orchestrator_id` to ensure that queries are routed to correct queues.

## Data sources

Cube supports various kinds of [data sources][ref-data-sources], ranging from cloud
data warehouses to embedded databases. Each data source scales differently,
therefore Cube provides sound defaults for each kind of data source out-of-the-box.

### Data source concurrency

By default, Cube uses the following concurrency settings for data sources:

| Data source | Default concurrency |
| --- | --- |
| [Amazon Athena][ref-athena] | 10 |
| [Amazon Redshift][ref-redshift] | 5 |
| [Apache Pinot][ref-pinot] | 10 |
| [ClickHouse][ref-clickhouse] | 10 |
| [Databricks][ref-databricks] | 10 |
| [Firebolt][ref-firebolt] | 10 |
| [Google BigQuery][ref-bigquery] | 10 |
| [Snowflake][ref-snowflake] | 8 |
| All other data sources | 5 or [less, if specified in the driver][link-github-data-source-concurrency] |

You can use the `CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY` environment variable to adjust the maximum
number of concurrent queries to a data source. It's recommended to use the default
configuration unless you're sure that your data source can handle more concurrent
queries.

### Connection pooling

For data sources that support connection pooling, the maximum number of concurrent
connections to the database can also be set by using the `CUBEJS_DB_MAX_POOL`
environment variable. If changing this from the default, you must ensure that the
new value is greater than the number of concurrent connections used by Cube's query
queues and the refresh worker.

## Refresh worker

By default, the refresh worker uses the same concurrency settings as API instances.
However, you can override this behvaior in the refresh worker
[configuration][ref-preagg-refresh].
