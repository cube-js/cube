# SingleStore

[SingleStore][link-singlestore] is a distributed SQL database that offers
high-throughput transactions (inserts and upserts) and low-latency analytics.

<SuccessBox>

SingleStore support is available in Cube Cloud on the
[Enterprise Premier](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tier.
[Contact us](https://cube.dev/contact) for details.

/>

On the <Btn>Connect to Workspace</Btn> page, you can find the host name
(`svc-<UUID>-dml.<REGION>.svc.singlestore.com`):

You have set the password when creating the workspace. If you'd like to reset
the password, navigate to the <Btn>Access</Btn> tab within your workspace.

## Pre-Aggregation Feature Support

Measures of type
[`count_distinct_approx`][ref-schema-ref-types-formats-countdistinctapprox] can
not be used in pre-aggregations when using SingleStore as a source
database.

## Pre-Aggregation Build Strategies

<InfoBox>

To learn more about pre-aggregation build strategies, [head
here][ref-caching-using-preaggs-build-strats].

</InfoBox>

| Feature       | Works with read-only mode? | Is default? |
| ------------- | :------------------------: | :---------: |
| Simple        |             ✅             |     ✅      |
| Batching      |             -              |      -      |
| Export Bucket |             -              |      -      |

By default, SingleStore uses a [simple][self-preaggs-simple] strategy
to build pre-aggregations.

### Simple

No extra configuration is required to configure simple pre-aggregation builds
for SingleStore.

### Batching

SingleStore does not support batching.

### Export Bucket

SingleStore does not support export buckets.
