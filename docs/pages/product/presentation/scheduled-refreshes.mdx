# Scheduled Refreshes

<InfoBox>
  Scheduled refreshes are available on [Premium and Enterprise plans](https://cube.dev/pricing).

You can set up Cube dashboards to automatically update on a schedule. When a scheduled refresh is triggered, the widgets on the dashboard are queried in the background, refreshing Cube's in-memory cache. This warms up dashboards so they load instantly when users open them, eliminating wait times for data to load.

## Accessing scheduled refreshes

Access scheduled refreshes from the dashboard builder or published dashboard by clicking the calendar icon, which opens the scheduled refreshes sidebar. From this sidebar, you can create new schedules, modify existing ones, or remove schedules you no longer need.
