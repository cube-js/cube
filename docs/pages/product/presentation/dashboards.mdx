# Dashboards

Dashboards let you select and organize reports from your workbooks into polished, shareable views for your team and stakeholders. Transform your exploratory analysis into production-ready deliverables by choosing which insights to highlight and present.

## Use cases

Dashboards enable you to:

- **Monitor key metrics** – Display critical business indicators that refresh with live data
- **Distribute analysis** – Package your findings into reports for regular distribution
- **Build data tools** – Develop specialized applications powered by your semantic layer
- **Present insights** – Showcase important discoveries in a polished, accessible format

## How it works

Select the reports you want to include from your [workbook][ref-workbooks], arrange them to tell your data story, and publish the dashboard. This gives stakeholders direct access to the insights that matter most, without the complexity of the underlying analysis.
