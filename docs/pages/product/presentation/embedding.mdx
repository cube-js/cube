Cube supports iframe embedding for [dashboards](/product/presentation/dashboards) and [analytics chat](/product/exploration/analytics-chat). Two authentication methods are available:

- **[Private Embedding](/product/presentation/embedding/private-embedding)** – Users authenticate directly with Cube to access embedded content. Users must have Cube accounts and will be prompted to sign in when accessing embedded iframes.

- **[Signed Embedding](/product/presentation/embedding/signed-embedding)** – Authentication is handled programmatically using JWT tokens generated by your application. Users authenticate through your application and do not require Cube accounts.

Additionally, you can use the [Cube Core REST API](/product/apis-integrations/rest-api) directly for headless embedded analytics.

## Types of Embedding

### Private Embedding

Private embedding is ideal for **internal use cases** where users already have Cube accounts. This is perfect for embedding dashboards and analytics into internal tools such as:

- Notion pages for team collaboration
- Salesforce or other CRM systems
- Internal wikis and documentation
- Company intranets and portals

Users will authenticate with their existing Cube credentials when accessing embedded content.

### Signed Embedding

Signed embedding is designed for **external, customer-facing analytics**. It uses JWT tokens for seamless authentication, making it ideal for:

- Embedding analytics in your SaaS application for customers
- White-label analytics solutions
- Multi-tenant applications where each customer sees their own data
- Public-facing dashboards with controlled access

Users authenticate through your application without needing Cube accounts, providing a seamless experience.
