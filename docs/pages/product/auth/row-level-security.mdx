# Row-level security

The data model serves as a facade of your data. With row-level security,
you can define whether some [data model][ref-data-modeling-concepts] facts are exposed
to end users and can be queried via [APIs & integrations][ref-apis].

Row-level security in Cube is similar to row-level security in SQL databases.
Defining whether users have access to specific facts from [cubes][ref-cubes] and
[views][ref-views] is similar to defining access to rows in database tables.

__By default, all rows are *public*,__ meaning that no filtering is applied to
data model facts when they are accessed by any users.

## Managing row-level access

You can implement row-level access control by applying additional filters conditionally
in the [`query_rewrite` configuration option][ref-query-rewrite].

### Dynamic data models

You can implement row-level access control at the data model level
[dynamically][ref-dynamic-data-modeling] by adjusting the [`sql` parameter][ref-cubes-sql]
of cubes.

## Best practices

### Data access policies

You can use [data access policies][ref-dap] to manage both [member-level][ref-mls]
and row-level security for different roles. With them, you can define access control
rules in data model files instead of mixing them together in a single block of code
in `query_rewrite`.

__It is recommended to use data access policies by default.__ You can also combine
them with using your own code in `query_rewrite` for specific cases.
