# Identity provider

Some visualization tools (e.g., [Cube Cloud for Sheets][ref-cube-cloud-sheets]) implement
an OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate users.

<SuccessBox>

OAuth 2.0 flow is available in Cube Cloud on [Premium and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.

</SuccessBox>

During this flow, users are redirected to a login page of an identity provider (e.g., Google)
where they enter their credentials. Then, the identity provider passes the user identity
information to Cube Cloud.

## Configuration

This method does not require any configuration.
