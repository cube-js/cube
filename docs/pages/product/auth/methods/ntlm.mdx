# NTLM authentication

[NTLM][link-ntlm] is an authentication method developed by Microsoft that can be used to
authenticate requests to [DAX API][ref-dax-api] and [MDX API][ref-mdx-api].

<SuccessBox>

DAX API and MDX API are available in Cube Cloud on [Enterprise and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.
They also require the M [deployment tier](/product/deployment/cloud/pricing#deployment-tiers).

On the diagram below, NTLM is used to authenticate requests from Power BI Service that
come through the [on-premises data gateway][link-power-bi-opdg] (step 6):

## Authentication flow

The NTLM authentication can be used with Power BI Desktop or with Power BI Service and
the [on-premises data gateway][link-power-bi-opdg].

### Power BI Desktop

Initiated by Power BI Desktop, NTLM authentication works as follows:

* Power BI Desktop is launched under a specific user account via the `runas` command.
* Power BI Desktop performs an NTLM challenge-response authentication and passes the
credentials of that account to the Cube Cloud deployment.
* The Cube Cloud deployment [verifies the credentials](#verifying-the-credentials).

In the following example, Power BI Desktop is launched under the `cube` user:

```bash
# Run Power BI Desktop as the `cube` user
runas /user:cube "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Power BI Desktop\bin\PBIDesktop.exe"

# Run a specific report in Power BI Desktop as the `cube` user 
runas /user:cube "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Power BI Desktop\bin\PBIDesktop.exe \"C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Dashboard.pbix\""
```

__This flow should only be used for testing purposes.__ Note that, when Power BI Desktop
is started as a user different from the currently logged-in Windows account, it may
encounter permission issues, e.g., when saving files on network drives.

In a production environment, Power BI Desktop should be used with [Kerberos
authentication][ref-kerberos].

### Power BI Service

Initiated by Power BI Service, NTLM authentication works as follows:

* [The gateway is configured](#installing-the-gateway) with a master user account.
* When users interact with a Power BI report in Power BI Service, their _user principal
name_ (UPN) is passed to the gateway.
* The gateway performs an NTLM challenge-response authentication and passes the the
credentials of the master user account to the Cube Cloud deployment. It also passes the
UPN of the interacting user.
* The Cube Cloud deployment [verifies the credentials](#verifying-the-credentials) and
changes the user name to the UPN of the interacting user.

__This is the recommended way to authenticate Power BI Service requests.__

## Configuration

Using NTLM authentication requires configuring the deployment to [verify the
credentials](#verifying-the-credentials).

To use NTLM authentication with Power BI Service, you also need to [install the on-premises
data gateway](#installing-the-gateway) first.

### Installing the gateway

You need to have the [on-premises data gateway][link-power-bi-opdg] installed
on a Windows Server machine.

It should be configured to authenticate with a _master user_ account. It can be a
local user on the machine or a domain user.

### Verifying the credentials

By default, `CUBEJS_SQL_USER` and `CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD` environment variables are used
to verify the passed credentials. You can also customize the authentication by using the
[`check_sql_auth` configuration option][ref-config-check-sql-auth].

Also, the `CUBEJS_SQL_SUPER_USER` environment variable or the [`can_switch_sql_user`
configuration option][ref-config-can-switch-sql-user] can be used to ensure that the
user name can be changed to the UPN of the interacting user only if proper credentials
of the master user account were passed.
