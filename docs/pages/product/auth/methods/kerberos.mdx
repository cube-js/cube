# Kerberos authentication

[Kerberos][link-kerberos] is the most common authentication method for Windows environments.
It can be used to authenticate requests to [DAX API][ref-dax-api] and [MDX API][ref-mdx-api].

<SuccessBox>

DAX API and MDX API are available in Cube Cloud on [Enterprise and above](https://cube.dev/pricing) product tiers.
They also require the M [deployment tier](/product/deployment/cloud/pricing#deployment-tiers).

On the diagram below, Kerberos is used to authenticate requests from Power BI Desktop (step 2):

## Authentication flow

__Kerberos is the recommended method to authenticate Power BI Desktop requests.__


It works as follows:

* Power BI Desktop is launched normally, under the Windows domain account of the user.
* When connecting the DAX API, Windows verifies whether its [service principal
name](#registering-the-spn) is registered in the domain.
* Once verified, the Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos ticket for the user.
* This ticket is transmitted to the DAX API in the request authorization header.
* The DAX API [decrypts and verifies](#configuring-the-deployment) the Kerberos ticket.
* Finally, the user principal name is passed for [further verification](#verifying-the-credentials).

## Configuration

Configuring Kerberos authentication includes the following steps:

* [Obtain a Windows Server machine](#obtaining-a-windows-machine) to use during the next steps.
* [Register the service principal name](#registering-the-spn).
* [Generate a keytab](#generating-the-keytab).
* [Configure the deployment](#configuring-the-deployment) to verify Kerberos tickets.
* Optionally, [customize the authentication](#verifying-the-credentials).

### Obtaining a Windows machine

To perform the next steps, you need a Windows Server virtual machine:

* It should be joined to the same domain as the organization’s users.
* It should have the [RSAT][link-rsat] feature enabled.
* It should be able to reach the [Key Distribution Center][link-kdc] (KDC). For example,
on Azure, this virtual machine can be created in the `aadds-vnet` subnet.

You should log in to this Windows Server machine using the account that has
[AAD DC Administrators][link-aad-dc-admins] group membership.

It is also recommended to create a custom organizational unit (OU) and a new user
in this OU that will act as the service account.

On the screenshot below, the `mdax-api-svc-account` user is created in the
`MyCustomOU` OU in the `CUBE` domain:

### Registering the SPN

A [service principal name][link-spn] (SPN) is a unique identifier of a service instance.
Kerberos authentication uses SPNs to associate a service instance with a service sign-in account.

First, obtain your Cube Cloud deployment’s domain by going to <Btn>Settings → General</Btn>
and copying the value in the <Btn>Custom domain</Btn> section.

Then, use the [`setspn` command][link-setspn] to register the Service Principal Name
for the DAX API.

In the following example, the web service (`HTTP`) SPN on the
`redundant-brohman.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev` domain is registered for the
`mdax-api-svc-account` user in the `CUBE` domain:

```
setspn -S HTTP/redundant-brohman.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev CUBE\mdax-api-svc-account
```

### Generating the keytab

The [keytab][link-keytab-file] file contains information needed to decrypt the Kerberos
token.

First, use the [`ktpass` command][link-ktpass] to generate the keytab file. You will be
prompted to enter the password for the specified user:

```
ktpass /out kerberos.keytab /princ HTTP/redundant-brohman.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev@CUBE.DEV /mapuser mdax-api-svc-account /crypto All /ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL /pass *
```

Then, convert the keytab to a Base64-encoded string. For example, the following PowerShell
script will do the conversion and put the result in the clipboard:

```ps
$Path = "C:\kerberos.keytab"
[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($Path)) | Set-Clipboard
```

### Configuring the deployment

Go to <Btn>Settings → Environment Variables</Btn> of your Cube Cloud deployment and set
the following environment variables to facilitate the verification of Kerberos tickets:

| Environment variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CUBE_XMLA_KRB5_KEYTAB_B64` | Base64-encoded keytab |
| `CUBE_XMLA_SPN` | `HTTP` |
| `KRB5_KTNAME` | `/cube/conf/kerberos.keytab` |

### Verifying the credentials

By default, `CUBEJS_SQL_USER` and `CUBEJS_SQL_PASSWORD` environment variables are used
to verify the passed credentials. You can also customize the authentication by using the
[`check_sql_auth` configuration option][ref-config-check-sql-auth].

Once the deployment is ready, you can test the Kerberos authentication by [connecting
from Power BI][ref-power-bi] to the DAX API.
