# Member-level security

The data model serves as a facade of your data. With member-level security,
you can define whether [data model entities][ref-data-modeling-concepts] (cubes, views,
and their members) are exposed to end users and can be queried via [APIs &
integrations][ref-apis].

Member-level security in Cube is similar to column-level security in SQL databases.
Defining whether users have access to [cubes][ref-cubes] and [views][ref-views] is
similar to defining access to database tables; defining whether they have access
to dimensions and measures — to columns.

__By default, all cubes, views, and their members are *public*,__ meaning that they
can be accessed by any users and they are also visible during data model introspection.

## Managing member-level access

You can explicitly make a data model entity public or private by setting its
`public` parameter to `true` or `false`. This parameter is available for
[cubes][ref-cubes-public], [views][ref-views-public], [measures][ref-measures-public],
[dimensions][ref-dimensions-public], [hierarchies][ref-hierarchies-public], and
[segments][ref-segments-public].

<InfoBox>

In [development mode][ref-dev-mode] and in [Playground][ref-playground], access
control checks are disabled and all `public` parameters are ignored. It helps
you conveniently debug the data model by using private data model entities in
API queries and during data model introspection.

### Dynamic data models

You can also control whether a data model entity should be public or private
[dynamically][ref-dynamic-data-modeling].

In the example below, the `customers` view would only be visible to a subset
of [tenants][ref-multitenancy] that have the `team` property set to `marketing`
in the security context: 

```yml filename="model/views/customers.yml"
views:
  - name: customers
    public: "{{ is_accessible_by_team('marketing', COMPILE_CONTEXT) }}"
```

```python filename="model/globals.py"
from cube import TemplateContext

template = TemplateContext()

@template.function('is_accessible_by_team')
def is_accessible_by_team(team: str, ctx: dict) -> bool:
  return team == ctx['securityContext'].setdefault('team', 'default')
```

If you'd like to keep a data model entity public but prevent access to it
anyway, you can use the [`query_rewrite` configuration option][ref-query-rewrite] for that.

## Best practices

### Data access policies

You can use [data access policies][ref-dap] to manage both member-level and
[row-level][ref-rls] security for different roles. With them, you can keep
access control rules in one place instead of spreading them across a number of
`public` parameters in a cube or a view.

__It is recommended to use data access policies by default.__ You can also combine
them with setting some `public` parameters manually for specific cases.

### Cubes and views

If your data model contains both [cubes][ref-cubes] and [views][ref-views],
it's recommended to keep cubes private and only expose views to visualization
tools. Doing so, you will have more control over queries that can be run
against the data model.

### Members

If you have measures or dimensions that are not intended to be exposed to end
users, it's recommended to keep them private. Often, such auxiliary members
would be used in [calculated measures and dimensions][ref-calculated-members].

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: users
    sql_table: users

    dimensions:
      - name: first_name
        sql: first_name
        type: string
        public: false

      - name: initial
        sql: "LEFT({first_name}, 1)"
        type: string



```

```javascript
cube(`users`, {
  sql_table: `users`,

  dimensions: {
    first_name: {
      sql: `first_name`,
      type: `string`,
      public: false
    },

    initial: {
      sql: `LEFT(${first_name}, 1)`,
      type: `string`
    }
  }
})
```
