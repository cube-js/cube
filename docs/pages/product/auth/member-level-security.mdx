# Member-level security

The data model serves as a facade of your data. With member-level security,
you can define whether [data model entities][ref-data-modeling-concepts] (cubes, views,
and their members) are exposed to end users and can be queried via [APIs &
integrations][ref-apis].

Member-level security in Cube is similar to column-level security in SQL databases.
Defining whether users have access to [cubes][ref-cubes] and [views][ref-views] is
similar to defining access to database tables; defining whether they have access
to dimensions and measures — to columns.

__By default, all cubes, views, and their members are *public*,__ meaning that they
can be accessed by any users and they are also visible during data model introspection.

## Managing member-level access

You can use [access policies][ref-dap] to configure member-level access
for different groups. With the `access_policy` parameter in
[cubes][ref-ref-cubes] and [views][ref-ref-views], you can define which members
are accessible to users with specific groups.

Use the `member_level` parameter to specify either:
- `includes`: a list of allowed members, or
- `excludes`: a list of disallowed members

You can use `"*"` as a shorthand to include or exclude all members.

When you define access policies for specific groups, access is automatically denied to all other groups. You don't need to create a default policy that denies access.

In the following example, member-level access is configured for different groups:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
views:
  - name: orders_view
    cubes:
      - join_path: orders
        includes:
          - status
          - created_at
          - count
          - count_7d
          - count_30d
    
    access_policy:
      # Managers can access all members except for `count`
      - group: manager
        member_level:
          excludes:
            - count
      
      # Observers can access all members except for `count` and `count_7d`
      - group: observer
        member_level:
          excludes:
            - count
            - count_7d
      
      # Guests can only access the `count_30d` measure
      - group: guest
        member_level:
          includes:
            - count_30d
```

```javascript
view(`orders_view`, {
  cubes: [
    {
      join_path: orders,
      includes: [
        `status`,
        `created_at`,
        `count`,
        `count_7d`,
        `count_30d`
      ]
    }
  ],

  access_policy: [
    {
      // Managers can access all members except for `count`
      group: `manager`,
      member_level: {
        excludes: [
          `count`
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      // Observers can access all members except for `count` and `count_7d`
      group: `observer`,
      member_level: {
        excludes: [
          `count`,
          `count_7d`
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      // Guests can only access the `count_30d` measure
      group: `guest`,
      member_level: {
        includes: [
          `count_30d`
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</CodeTabs>

This configuration results in the following access:

| Group | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `manager` | All members except for `count` |
| `observer` | All members except for `count` and `count_7d` |
| `guest` | Only the `count_30d` measure |
| All other users | No access to this view at all |

Access policies also respect member-level security restrictions configured via
`public` parameters. For more details, see the [access policies
reference][ref-dap-ref].
