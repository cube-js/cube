# Data access policies

Data access policies provide a holistic mechanism to manage [member-level](#member-level-access)
and [row-level](#row-level-access) security for different [data access roles](#data-access-roles).
You can define access control rules in data model files, allowing for an organized
and maintainable approach to security.

## Data access roles

Each request to Cube includes a [security context][ref-sec-ctx], which can contain
information about the user. You can use the [`context_to_roles` configuration
option][ref-ctx-to-roles] to derive the user's roles from the security context:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from cube import config

@config('context_to_roles')
def context_to_roles(ctx: dict) -> list[str]:
  return ctx['securityContext'].get('roles', ['default'])
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  contextToRoles: ({ securityContext }) => {
    return securityContext.roles || ['default']
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

A user can have more than one role.

## Policies

You can define policies that target specific roles and contain member-level and (or)
row-level security rules:

<CodeTabs>

```yaml
cubes:
  - name: orders
    # ...

    access_policy:
        # For all roles, restrict access entirely
      - role: "*"
        member_level:
          includes: []

        # For the `manager` role,
        #   allow access to all members
        #   but filter rows by the user's country
      - role: manager
        conditions:
          - if: "{ securityContext.is_EMEA_based }"
        member_level:
          includes: "*"
        row_level:
          filters:
            - member: country
              operator: equals
              values: [ "{ securityContext.country }" ]
```

```javascript
cube(`orders`, {
  // ...

  access_policy: [
    {
      // For all roles, restrict access entirely
      role: `*`,
      member_level: {
        includes: []
      }
    },
    {
      // For the `manager` role,
      //   allow access to all members
      //   but filter rows by the user's country
      role: `manager`,
      conditions: [
        { if: securityContext.is_EMEA_based }
      ],
      member_level: {
        includes: `*`
      },
      row_level: {
        filters: [
          {
            member: `country`,
            operator: `equals`,
            values: [ securityContext.country ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

</CodeTabs>

You can define data access policies both in cubes and views. If you use views,
it is recommended to keep all your cubes private and define access policies in views only.
It will make your security rules easier to maintain and reason about, especially
when it comes to [member-level access](#member-level-access).

For more details on available parameters, check out the [data access policies reference][ref-ref-dap].

## Policy evaluation

When processing a request, Cube will evaluate the data access policies and combine them
with relevant custom security rules, e.g., [`public` parameters][ref-mls-public] for member-level security
and [`query_rewrite` filters][ref-rls-queryrewrite] for row-level security.

If multiple access policies apply to a request, they are _combined together_
using the _OR_ semantics. For example, if a user has two roles with different
policies, the user will get the union of the permissions in these policies.

### Member-level access

Member-level security rules in data access policies are _combined together_
with `public` parameters of cube and view members using the _AND_ semantics.
Both will apply to the request.

_When querying a view,_ member-level security rules defined in the view are _**not** combined together_
with member-level security rules defined in relevant cubes.
**Only the ones from the view will apply to the request.**

<InfoBox>

This is consistent with how column-level security works in SQL databases. If you have
a view that exposes a subset of columns from a table, it doesnt matter if the
columns in the table are public or not, the view will expose them anyway.

</InfoBox>

### Row-level access

Row-level filters in data access policies are _combined together_ with filters defined
using the [`query_rewrite` configuration option][ref-config-queryrewrite].
Both will apply to the request.

_When querying a view,_ row-level filters defined in the view are _combined together_
with row-level filters defined in relevant cubes. Both will apply to the request.

<InfoBox>

This is consistent with how row-level security works in SQL databases. If you have
a view that exposes a subset of rows from another view, the result set will be
filtered by the row-level security rules of both views.
