# Refreshing pre-aggregations

_Pre-aggregation refresh_ is the process of building pre-aggregations and updating
them with new data. Pre-aggregation refresh is the responsibility of the _refresh
worker_.

## Configuration

You can use the following environment variables to configure the refresh worker
behavior:

- `CUBEJS_REFRESH_WORKER` (see also `CUBEJS_PRE_AGGREGATIONS_BUILDER`)
- `CUBEJS_PRE_AGGREGATIONS_SCHEMA`
- `CUBEJS_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_TIMEZONES`
- `CUBEJS_DB_QUERY_TIMEOUT`
- `CUBEJS_REFRESH_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` (see also `CUBEJS_CONCURRENCY`)
- `CUBEJS_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_QUERIES_PER_APP_ID`
- `CUBEJS_DROP_PRE_AGG_WITHOUT_TOUCH`

## Troubleshooting

### `Refresh scheduler interval error`

Sometimes, you might come across the following error:

```json
{
  "message": "Refresh Scheduler Interval Error",
  "error": "Previous interval #2 was not finished with 60000 interval"
}
```

It indicates that your refresh worker is overloaded. You probably have a lot of
[tenants][ref-multitenancy], a lot of [pre-aggregations][ref-preaggs] to refresh,
or both.

If you're using [multitenancy][ref-multitenancy], you'd need to deploy several Cube
clusters (each one per a reduced set of tenants) so there will be multiple refresh
workers which will work only on a subset of your tenants.

If you're using Cube Cloud, you can use a [production multi-cluster][ref-production-multi-cluster]
that would automatically do this for you.
