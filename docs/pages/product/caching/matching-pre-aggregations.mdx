# Matching queries with pre-aggregations

When executing a query, Cube will try to match and fulfill it with the best
available pre-aggregation.

Since pre-aggregations contain a *condensed representation* of the data from
the upstream data source (rather than a copy of that data), Cube needs to ensure
that fulfilling a query with a pre-aggregation is possible and doing so will
produce correct results. 

If there's no matching pre-aggregation, Cube will fall back to querying
the upstream data source, unless the [rollup-only mode][ref-rollup-only-mode]
is enabled.

[common pitfalls](#common-pitfalls) first.

## Eligible pre-aggregations

Cube will search for matching pre-aggregations in all cubes that define
members in the query.

Pre-aggregations are tested in the order they are defined in the data model
file. However, `rollup` pre-aggregations are tested before `original_sql`
pre-aggregations.

The first pre-aggregation that matches a query is used.  

## Matching algorithm

Cube goes through the following steps to determine whether a query matches a
particular eligible pre-aggregation:

See the details for each step:

- **Is query leaf-measure additive?** Cube checks that all [leaf
measures][ref-leaf-measures] in the query are [additive][ref-measure-additivity].
If the query contains [calculated measures][ref-calculated-measures] (e.g.,
measures defined as `{sum} / {count}`), then referenced leaf measures will be
checked for additivity.
- **Does every member of the query exist in the pre-aggregation?** Cube checks
that the pre-aggregation contains all dimensions, filter dimensions, and leaf
measures from the query.
- **Are any query measures multiplied in the cube's data model?** Cube checks
if any measures are multiplied via a [`one_to_many`
relationship][ref-schema-joins-rel] between cubes in the query.
- **Does the query specify granularity for its time dimension?** Cube checks
that the time dimension granularity is set in the query.
- **Are query filter dimensions included in its own dimensions?** Cube checks
that all filter dimensions are also included as dimensions in the query.
- **Does every member in the query exist in the pre-aggregation?** Cube checks
that the pre-aggregation contains all dimensions and measures used in the query.

### Matching time dimensions

There are extra considerations that apply to matching time dimensions.

- **Time dimension and granularity in the query together act as a dimension.**
If the date range isn't aligned with granularity, a common granularity is used.
This common granularity is selected using the [greatest common divisor][wiki-gcd]
across both the query and pre-aggregation. For example, the common granularity
between `hour` and `day` is `hour` because both `hour` and `day` can be divided
by `hour`.
- **The query's granularity's date range must match the start date and end date
from time dimensions.** For example, when using a granularity of `month`,
the values should be the start and end days of the month, i.e.,
`['2020-01-01T00:00:00.000', '2020-01-31T23:59:59.999']`; when the granularity
is `day`, the values should be the start and end hours of the day, i.e.,
`['2020-01-01T00:00:00.000', '2020-01-01T23:59:59.999']`. Date ranges are
inclusive, and the minimum granularity is `second`. Use the
[`allow_non_strict_date_range_match`][ref-non-strict-date-range-match] to allow
a pre-aggregation to match a non-strict date range anyway.
- **The time zone in the query must match the time zone of a pre-aggregation.**
You can configure a list of time zones that pre-aggregations will be built for
using the [`scheduled_refresh_time_zones`][ref-conf-scheduled-refresh-time-zones]
configuration option.

If a query specifies a [custom granularity][ref-custom-granularity] for its time
dimension, then a matching pre-aggregation with the same custom granularity will
be used even if there is also an matching pre-aggregation with a default
granularity (e.g., `day` or `month`).

### Matching ungrouped queries

There are extra considerations that apply to matching [ungrouped
queries][ref-ungrouped-queries]:

- The pre-aggregation should include [primary keys][ref-primary-key] of all
cubes involved in the query.
- If multiple cubes are referenced in the query, the pre-aggregation should
include only members of these cubes.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not sure why a query does not match a pre-aggregation, try to identify
the part of the query that prevents it from matching. You can do that by
removing measures, dimensions, filters, etc. from your query until it matches.
Then, refer to the [matching algorithm](#matching-algorithm) and [common
pitfalls](#common-pitfalls) to understand why that part was an issue.

### Common pitfalls

- Most commonly, a query would not match a pre-aggregation because they contain
[non-additive measures][ref-measure-additivity]. See [this
recipe][ref-non-additive-recipe] for workarounds.

- If a query uses any time zone other than `UTC`, please check the section on
[matching time dimensions](#matching-time-dimensions) and the
[`scheduled_refresh_time_zones`][ref-conf-scheduled-refresh-time-zones]
configuration option.
