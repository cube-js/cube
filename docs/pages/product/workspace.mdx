With Cube Core, you can:

- Use the data model builder to generate the initial data model.
- Use [Playground][ref-playground] to run queries and test the data model.
- Use [Chart Prototyping][ref-vizard] to generate code of a front-end
  application that works with Cube.
- Use the [command-line tool][ref-cli] to automate your workflows.
