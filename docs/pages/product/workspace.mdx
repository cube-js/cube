# Workspace

Workspace tools are designed to help you build, test, deploy, and manage
Cube projects.

Most workspace tools depend on the [managed infrastructure][ref-infrastructure]
and are only available in Cube Cloud.

## Workspace tools in Cube Cloud

In Cube Cloud, you can:
* Use the [data model editor][ref-data-model] with the [development
mode][ref-dev-mode] and [Rollup Designer][ref-rollup-designer] to build
the data model of your semantic layer.
* Use [SQL Runner][ref-sql-runner] to inform the development of the data
model.
* Use [Playground][ref-playground] to run queries and test the data model.
* Use [Chart Prototyping][ref-vizard] to generate code of a front-end
application that works with Cube.
* Use [Semantic Layer Sync][ref-sls] to connect your semantic layer to BI
tools.
* Use [Query History][ref-query-history] to observe queries and their
performance in real-time.
* Use the [pre-aggregations page][ref-pre-aggs] to inspect pre-aggregations
and their build history.
* Use [Performance Insights][ref-perf-insights] to analyze the performance
of your deployment as a whole.
* Use the [access control page][ref-access-control] to manage users of your
Cube Cloud account and [single sign-on][ref-sso].
* Use [Budgets][ref-budgets] to control the usage and spend of your Cube
Cloud account.
* Use [Preferences][ref-prefs] to adjust the workspace to your liking.

## Workspace tools in Cube Core

With Cube Core, you can:

* Use the data model builder to generate the initial data model.
* Use [Playground][ref-playground] to run queries and test the data model.
* Use the [command-line tool][ref-cli] to automate your workflows.
