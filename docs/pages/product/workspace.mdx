# Workspace

Workspace tools are designed to help you build, test, deploy, and manage
Cube projects.

<SuccessBox>

Most workspace tools depend on the [managed infrastructure][ref-infrastructure]
and are only available in Cube Cloud.

## Workspace tools in Cube Cloud

In Cube Cloud, you can:

- Use the [data model editor][ref-data-model] with the [development
  mode][ref-dev-mode] and [Rollup Designer][ref-rollup-designer] to build
  the data model of your semantic layer.
- Use [SQL Runner][ref-sql-runner] to inform the development of the data
  model.
- Use [Playground][ref-playground] to run queries and test the data model.
- Use [Chart Prototyping][ref-vizard] to generate code of a front-end
  application that works with Cube.
- Use [Semantic Layer Sync][ref-sls] to connect your semantic layer to BI
  tools.
- Use [Query History][ref-query-history] to observe queries and their
  performance in real-time.
- Use the [pre-aggregations page][ref-pre-aggs] to inspect pre-aggregations
  and their build history.
- Use [Performance Insights][ref-perf-insights] to analyze the performance
  of your deployment as a whole.
- Use [Monitoring Integrations][ref-monitoring-integrations] to export logs and
metrics to external monitoring tools.
- Use the [access control page][ref-access-control] to manage users of your
  Cube Cloud account and [single sign-on][ref-sso].
- Use [Audit Log][ref-audit-log] to review security-related events in your
Cube Cloud account.
- Use [Budgets][ref-budgets] to control the usage and spend of your Cube
  Cloud account.
- Use [Preferences][ref-prefs] to adjust the workspace to your liking.
- Use [AI Assistant][ref-ai-assistant] to explore and query data with natural language.
- Use [Semantic Catalog][ref-semantic-catalog] to search a unified view of connected data assets, see lineage, and explore connected BI content.
