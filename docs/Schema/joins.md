The `joins` parameter declares a block to define relationships between cubes.
It allows users to access and compare fields from two or more cubes at the same time.

```javascript
joins: {
  TargetCubeName: {
    relationship: `belongsTo` || `hasMany` || `hasOne`,
    sql: `SQL ON clause`
  }
}
```

## Parameters

### relationship

`relationship` enables you to describe the join relationship between joined cubes.
It’s important to properly define the type of relationship in order for Cube.js
to calculate accurate measures.

<div class="block help-block">
  <p><b>Note:</b> It is very important to define the correct order of cubes in a join. It affects data in the result-set greatly.</p>
  <p>The basic cube represents the left entity in a join, all others would be right. That means that all rows of the left cube are selected, while rows of the right depend on the condition.</p>
  <p>For more information and specific examples, please take a look at our <a href="direction-of-joins">guides</a>.</p>
</div>


The three possible values for a relationship are:

#### hasOne

A `hasOne` relationship indicates a one-to-one connection with another cube. This relationship
indicates that the one row in the cube can match only one row in the joined cube. For example,
in a model containing users and user profiles, the users cube would have the following join:

```javascript
cube("Users", {
  joins: {
    Profile: {
      relationship: `hasOne`,
      sql: `${Users}.id = ${Profile}.user_id`
    }
  }
});
```

#### hasMany

A `hasMany` relationship indicates a one-to-many connection with another cube.
You'll often find this relationship on the "other side" of a `belongsTo`
relationship. This relationship indicates that the one row in the cube can match many rows in the joined cube.
For example, in a model containing authors and books, the authors cube would have the following join:

```javascript
cube("Authors", {
  joins: {
    Books: {
      relationship: `hasMany`,
      sql: `${Authors}.id = ${Books}.author_id`
    }
  }
});
```

#### belongsTo

A `belongsTo` relationship indicates a many-to-one connection with another cube. You’ll often find this relationship on the “other side” of a `hasMany` relationship. This relationship indicates that the one row of the declaring cube matches a row in the joined instance, while the joined instance can have many rows in the declaring cube. For example, in a model containing orders and customers, the orders cube would have the following join:

```javascript
cube("Orders", {
  joins: {
    Customers: {
      relationship: `belongsTo`,
      sql: `${Orders}.customer_id = ${Customers}.id`
    }
  }
});
```

### sql

`sql` is necessary to indicate a related column between cubes. It is important to properly specify a matching column when creating joins. Take a look at the example below:
```javascript
  sql: `${Orders}.customer_id = ${Customers}.id`
```

## Setting a Primary Key

In order to make `join` work, it is necessary to define a `primaryKey` as specified below.
It's required when a join is defined because Cube.js takes care of row multiplication issues.

Let's imagine you want to calculate `Order Amount` by `Order Item Product Name`.
In this case, `Order` rows will be multiplied by the `Order Item` join due to the `hasMany` relationship.
In order to produce correct results, Cube.js will select distinct primary keys from `Order` first and then will join these primary keys with `Order` to get the correct `Order Amount` sum result.
Please note that `primaryKey` should be defined in the `dimensions` section.

```javascript
dimensions: {
  authorId: {
    sql: `id`,
    type: `number`,
    primaryKey: true
  }
}
```
<div class="block help-block">
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b>
    Setting <code>primaryKey</code> to <code>true</code> will change the default value of the <code>shown</code> parameter to <code>false</code>. If you still want <code>shown</code> to be <code>true</code>—set it manually.
  </p>
</div>

```javascript
dimensions: {
  authorId: {
    sql: `id`,
    type: `number`,
    primaryKey: true,
    shown: true
  }
}
```

If you don't have a single column in a cube's table that can act as a primary key,
you can create a composite primary key as shown below.

_The example uses Postgres string concatenation; note that SQL may be
different depending on your database._

```javascript
dimensions: {
  id: {
    sql: `${CUBE}.user_id || '-' || ${CUBE}.signup_week || '-' || ${CUBE}.activity_week`,
    type: `string`,
    primaryKey: true
  }
}
```

## CUBE reference

When you have several joined cubes, you should accurately use columns’ names to avoid any mistakes. One way to make no mistakes is to use the `${CUBE}` reference. It allows you to specify columns’ names in cubes without any ambiguity. During the implementation of the query, this reference will be used as an alias for a basic cube. Take a look at the following example:

```javascript
dimensions: {
  name: {
    sql: `${CUBE}.name`,
    type: `string`
  }
}
```
